Welcome to PianoThemes on You Tube<br />
<br />
PianoThemes is Unique new approach to supplying music fans with their favorite tunes from movies and games.<br />
The new idea is to arrange the piece to piano, then either reinsert it or assign it to some original footage where the music came from. This is all apart from providing the sheet music for free at www.pianothemes.com.<br />
<br />
Now yes we do have some videos of our performer and arranger playing the keyboard to some of the tunes, sort of similar to the famous channel for Kyle556, but not nearly as many videos of course, and ours are merely experimental.<br />
<br />
The final stage of PianoThemes will be to have a vast amount of videos full of live piano music being played to our classic favorite movies and games.<br />
<br />
So Sit back, relax, and enjoy this great new experience only known as PianoThemes.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget to pick up your free sheet music at

<li>An American Tail - Piano Score</li>
                
From the Academy Award winning animated motion picture, by Stephen Spielberg and Don Bluth, comes the story of Fievel, a small mouse lost in a big new world. This heartwarming story is so well animated, and the music by James Horner is considered some of his best work to date.<br />
Don't forget to pick up the sheet music for this song entitled 'The Market Place' from www.pianothemes.com<br />

<li>Casper--Piano-Score</li>
                
The live Casper movie was in general a big shock in its release. It was a true hybrid in Hollywood films, lying somewhere between a children's movie and an adult drama - Great nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Aside from the movie's unusual portrayal, within it lies perhaps one of James Horner's most beautifully composed songs ever, carrying a simple melancholy piano line. That song is 'One Last Wish', and it is played over this tribute video.<br />

<li>Star-Wars--The-Empire-Strikes-Back--Piano-Score</li>
                
This is another great example of the replacement of original music with arranged piano. This is the 'Asteroid Field' scene from Star Wars Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. The music is incorporated into the existing audio as opposed to replacing it completely. ENJOY!!<br />
