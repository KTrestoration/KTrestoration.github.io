You know you love me,<br />
I know you care,<br />
just shout whenever,<br />
and I'll be there.<br />
You are my love,<br />
you are my heart.<br />
And we will we never,ever,ever,be apart.Are we an item?<br />
Girl quit playin.<br />
We're just friends?<br />
What are you sayin?<br />
Said there's another and looked right in my eyes.<br />
My first love broke my heart for the first time.<br />
And I was like baby.baby,baby,ohh.<br />
Like baby.baby,baby,noo.<br />
Like,baby,baby,baby,ohh.<br />
Thought you'd always be mine,mine.<br />
(2x)<br />
For you I would've done whatever,and I just can't believe we ain't together.<br />
And I wanna play it cool,but I'm losin you.I'll buy you anything,I'll buy you any ring.And I'm in pieces,baby,fix me.<br />
And you shake me till you wake me from this bad dream.<br />
I'm goin down,down,down,down,and I just can't believe my first love won't be around.<br />
And I was like baby,baby,baby,ohh.<br />
Like baby,baby,baby,noo.<br />
Like baby,baby,baby,ohh.<br />
Thought you'd always be mine,mine.<br />
(2x)<br />
(LUDA)When I was 13,I had my first love,there was nobody that compared to my baby,ain't nobody came between us or could ever come above.She had me goin' crazy,oh I was starstruck.She woke me up daily,don't need no starbucks.She made my heart pound,skip a beat when I see her in the street and,and school on the playground,but I really wanna see her on the weekend.She know she got me gazing,cuz she was so amazing,and now my heart is breakin but I just keep on sayin,<br />
Baby,baby,baby,ohh.<br />
Like baby,baby,baby,noo.<br />
Like baby,baby,baby,ohh.<br />
Thought you'd always be mine,mine.<br />
(2x)<br />
(i'm gone)<br />
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah<br />
(now I'm all gone)<br />
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah<br />
(Now I'm all gone)<br />
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah<br />
(Now I'm all gone,gone,gone,I'm gone)
