PLEASE READ DISCRIPTION BEFORE WATCHING. The first episode of Charlie the Unicorn!!!  :D I don't own Charlie the Unicorn, it belongs to www. Film Cow .com (Don't watch their videos, most of them are bad, you'll regret it!!!!) Sorry about the sound, but they use bad words in the episode so I said the lines myself without the bad words. P.S. This may be boring but Charlie the Unicorn 2 has no bad words so I put the audio in the 2nd one!!!
