I get wings to fly<br />
Oh, oh, I'm alive...<br />
Yeah<br />
<br />
When you call on me<br />
When I hear you breathe<br />
I get wings to fly<br />
I feel that I’m alive<br />
<br />
When you look at me<br />
I can touch the sky<br />
I know that I’m alive<br />
Mmmmm Ohhhhh<br />
<br />
When you bless the day<br />
I just drift away<br />
All my worries die<br />
I’m glad that I’m alive<br />
<br />
You’ve set my heart on fire<br />
Filled me with love<br />
Made me a woman<br />
On clouds above<br />
<br />
I couldn’t get much higher<br />
My spirit takes flight<br />
Cause I am alive<br />
OHHHHH<br />
<br />
(When you call on me)<br />
When you call on me<br />
(When I hear you breathe)<br />
When I hear you breathe<br />
(I get wings to fly)<br />
Fly<br />
I feel that I’m alive<br />
I am alive<br />
<br />
(When you reach for me)<br />
When you reach for me<br />
(Raising spirits high)<br />
God knows that<br />
<br />
That I’ll be the one<br />
Standing by<br />
<br />
Through good and<br />
Through trying times<br />
<br />
And it’s only begun<br />
I can’t wait for the<br />
Rest of my life<br />
<br />
(When you call on me)<br />
When you call on me<br />
(When you reach for me)<br />
When you reach for me<br />
I get wings to fly<br />
I feel that I'm alive<br />
<br />
(When you bless the day)<br />
When you bless, you bless the day<br />
(I just drift away)<br />
I just drift away<br />
(All my worries die)<br />
I know that I’m alive<br />
<br />
I get wings to fly<br />
God knows that I’m alive

Did I hear you right?<br />
Cause I thought you said<br />
Let's think it over<br />
You have been my life<br />
And I never planned<br />
Growing old without you<br />
<br />
Shadows bleeding through the light<br />
Where the love once shined so bright<br />
Came without a reason<br />
Don't let go on us tonight<br />
Love's not always black and white<br />
Haven't I always loved you?<br />
<br />
<br />
But when I need you<br />
You're almost here<br />
And I know that's not enough<br />
And when I'm with you<br />
I'm close to tears<br />
'cause your only almost here<br />
<br />
<br />
I would change the world<br />
If I had a chance<br />
Oh won't you let me<br />
Treat me like a child<br />
Throw your arms around me<br />
Oh please protect me<br />
<br />
Brian & Delta:<br />
Bruise and battered by your words<br />
Days are shattered, how it hurts<br />
<br />
Oh, haven't I always loved you?<br />
<br />
But when I need you<br />
You're almost here<br />
And I know that's not enough<br />
And when I'm with you<br />
I'm close to tears<br />
'cause your only almost here<br />
<br />
Bruise and battered by your words<br />
Days are shattered, now it hurts<br />
<br />
Haven't I always loved you?<br />
<br />
But when I need you<br />
You're almost here<br />
<br />
Well I never knew how far behind I'd left you<br />
<br />
And when I hold you<br />
You're almost here<br />
<br />
Well I'm sorry that I took our love for granted<br />
<br />
<br />
And now I'm with you<br />
I'm close to tears<br />
<br />
Cause I know I'm almost here<br />
<br />
Only almost here

<li>Cabin-Fever</li>
                
I got cabin fever it's burning in my brain<br />
I've got cabin fever it's driving me insane<br />
We got cabin fever, we're flipping our bandanas<br />
Been stuck at sea so long we have simply gone bananas<br />
<br />
Ariba!<br />
Chica chica boom<br />
A chica chica boom boom chic<br />
Chica chica boom<br />
A chica chica boom boom chic<br />
<br />
We got cabin fever we've lost what sense we had<br />
We got cabin fever, we're all going mad<br />
<br />
*** [does not appear in movie, but is on the soundtrack]<br />
<br />
My sanity is hanging by a thread<br />
Since we're going nowhere I've gone out of my head<br />
We were sailing sailing over the bounding main<br />
(Lew Zealand:) And now we're not! Ha ha heh!<br />
***<br />
<br />
Grab your partner by the ears<br />
Lash him to the wheel<br />
Do-si-do step on his toe<br />
Listen to him squeal<br />
Allemande left, allemande right<br />
It's time to sail or sink<br />
Swing your partner over the side<br />
Drop him in the drink<br />
<br />
We got cabin fever<br />
No if's, and's, or but's<br />
We're disoriented<br />
And demented<br />
And a little nuts<br />
<br />
Ach du lieber Volswagen car<br />
(Yodel-lay-ee-hoo)<br />
Saur braten viener schnitzel<br />
Und a vunder bar<br />
(Yodel-lay-ee-hoo)<br />
<br />
We were sailing, sailing the wind was on our side<br />
And then it died<br />
<br />
I've got cabin fever<br />
I think I've lost my grip<br />
I'd like to get my hands on<br />
Whoever wrote this script<br />
Si!<br />
<br />
I was floating 'neath a tropic moon<br />
And dreaming of a blue lagoon<br />
Now I'm crazy as a loon<br />
<br />
Cabin fever has ravaged all aboard<br />
This once proud vessel has become a floating psycho ward<br />
We were sailing, sailing headed who knows where<br />
And now though we're all here<br />
We're not all there<br />
<br />
Cabin fever!<br />
<br />

Take my photo off the wall<br />
If it just won't sing for you<br />
'Cause all that's left has gone away<br />
And there's nothing there for you to prove<br />
Oh, look what you've done<br />
You've made a fool of everyone<br />
Oh well, it seems likes such fun<br />
Until you lose what you had won<br />
<br />
Give me back my point of view<br />
'Cause I just can't think for you<br />
I can hardly hear you say<br />
What should I do, well you choose<br />
<br />
Oh, look what you've done<br />
You've made a fool of everyone<br />
Oh well, it seems likes such fun<br />
Until you lose what you had won<br />
<br />
Oh, look what you've done<br />

<li>my-mother--real-voices</li>
                
It's hard to remember<br />
A summer or winter<br />
When she hasn't been there for me<br />
<br />
A friend and companion<br />
I can always depend on<br />
My mother<br />
That's who I mean<br />
<br />
I've taken for granted<br />
seeds that she planted<br />
She's always behind every thing<br />
<br />
A teacher a seeker<br />
A both arms outreacher<br />
My mother<br />
That's who I mean<br />
<br />
Wish I could slow down<br />
The hands of time<br />
keep things the way they are<br />
If she said so<br />
I would give her the world<br />
If I could... I would<br />
<br />
My love and my laughter<br />
From here ever after<br />
Is all that she says that she needs<br />
<br />
A friend and companion<br />
I can always depend on<br />
My mother<br />
That's who I mean<br />
My mother<br />
That's who I mean... that's who I mean

Heart, don't fail me now!<br />
Courage, don't desert me!<br />
Don't turnback<br />
Now that we're here<br />
People always say<br />
Life is full of choices<br />
No one ever mentions fear!<br />
Or how a road can seem so long<br />
How the world can seem so vast<br />
Courage see me through<br />
Heart I'm trusting you<br />
On this journey...to the past<br />
<br />
Somewhere down this road<br />
I know someone's waitingg<br />
Years of dreams<br />
Just can't be wrong<br />
Arms will open wide<br />
I'll be safe and wanted<br />
Fin'lly home where I belong<br />
Well, starting here, my life begins<br />
Starting now, I'm learning fast<br />
Courage see me through<br />
Heart I'm trusting you<br />
On this journey...to the past<br />
<br />
Heart don't fail me now!<br />
Courage don't desert me!<br />
<br />
Home, Love, Family<br />
There was once a time<br />
I must have had them too<br />
Home, Love, Family<br />
I will never be complete<br />
Until I find you...<br />
<br />
One step at a time<br />
One hope, then another<br />
Who knows where<br />
This road may go-<br />
Back to who i was<br />
On to find my future<br />
Things my heartstill<br />
Needs to know<br />
Yes, let this be a sign!<br />
Let, this road be mine!<br />
Let it lead me to my past<br />
Courage see me through<br />
Heart I'm trusting you<br />
To bring me home...<br />
At last!<br />
At Last!<br />
