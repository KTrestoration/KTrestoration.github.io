24-hour preschool television channel Sprout will premiere Justin Time, a new animated series for preschoolers that focuses on imaginary adventures and delivers fun, friendship and adventure along the way. Produced by Toronto’s Guru Studios, the show centers on Justin, a young boy who imagines himself traveling around the world at different points in history. Debuting Sunday, April 22, at 3:45 p.m. ET, the premiere of Justin Time kicks off a week-long celebration – “Justin Time for Earth Week”– promoting conservation and the importance of caring for the environment. Celebrating Earth Week for the past seven years, Sprout is a proud supporter of Green is Universal, NBCUniversal’s ongoing environmental initiative, and will be turning its on-air and online logos green all week long. Justin Time will also be making its broadcast television debut on July 7 when it airs on the new NBC Kids, programmed by Sprout. /nTo view Multimedia News Release, go to http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/sprout/48465/

Kids are willing to do almost anything to get the toys they want for Christmas according to Walmart’s Talking Holiday Toys Survey, which found that 68 percent of kids said they would clean their rooms daily for a year, while 84 percent would work hard and give up playtime. But every child has limits; only 23 percent of kids would eat spinach for a year to get their holiday toys. The Walmart–commissioned survey also found that mom and dad favor educational toys and are focused on price./nTo view Multimedia News Release, go to http://www.multivu.com/mnr/59182-walmart-holiday-toys-survey
