There are so many little faces in the corners of the world.

Living daily, every moment, in the corners of the world.
I bend down to see their eyes and they, oh they shine. There are so many little faces in the corners of the world.
Living, laughing, running all around the corners of the world.
I slow down to see their smiles and they, oh they shine. And the world goes ‘round and I’m lost in their sound.
And the world goes ‘round, I don’t want to be found. There’s so little time to see all of the corners of the world.
But you can’t be in a hurry to see the corners of the world.
Life goes by in real time and oh we shine. And the world goes ‘round and I’m lost in their sound.
And the world goes ‘round, I don’t want to be found. And the world goes ‘round and I’m lost in their sound.
And the world goes ‘round, I don’t want to be found.

I think I’m a little bit different from you.
That’s okay, you’re a bit different too.
Side by side, what great friends we’re gonna be, oh yeah.
Even though we see things differently. I see dreams, I dream I see.
I hear dreams in melodies.
Come and listen as I sing every dream I see.

Listen
Listen close
Don’t strain your ears
But listen hard
I promise if you listen
You’ll hear something you hear often
Listen to the black wristwatch 
with pure gold lining
A high pitch noise
Louder than a whisper
Smaller than a yell
Tick tock tick tock

I don’t want to grow up very fast.
I would like my childhood to last.
I’ll be older someday, older soon enough.
But for now I’m still a little young. Everybody wants me to be good.
Sometimes I don’t do the things I should.
I am just beginning to learn from what I’ve done.
That’s the way we are when we are young.  Sometimes I don’t know which way to go.
I’m not sure I really ought to know.
Have a little patience, watch me grow.
Then don’t try to stop me.
Nobody will top me. I don’t want to grow up very fast.
I would like my childhood to last.
I’ll be older someday, older soon enough.
Though I’d like to be forever young.
Why can’t we all stay forever young.

<li>Lost-and-Found--Chautauqua-Elementary</li>
                
Come let's take a walk outside. 
There's no telling what we'll find. 
Maybe something new or something old. 
Either way it's clear to see, life is just a mystery. 
But there's one thing I know. 
It's like the lost and found. 
A toy dropped on the ground, a coat left hanging on a tree 
Everything we find that someone leaves behind, I know, is waiting patiently. 
It's like the lost and found, it's scattered all around 
So much, it's getting hard to see. 
Everything that's lost is gathered up and tossed right here, and it's waiting patiently 
It's like the lost and found. 
A toy dropped on the ground, a coat left hanging on a tree 
Everything we find that someone leaves behind, I know, is waiting patiently. 
I know is waiting patiently.

<li>Wheres-My-Pen--Chautauqua-Elementary</li>
                
I was sitting at my desk and guess what happened then?
Someone came along and took my pen.
I don’t want to be mad but I can’t comprehend.
Now all I want to know is WHERE’S MY PEN?  It disappeared, but I can’t really tell you when.
It’s not like I have got a lot of cash to spend.
I don’t mean to be angry but I’ll ask again.
I really want to find out WHERE’S MY PEN?  I asked my friend, I asked some men, I even asked Ken.
But once again there’s no one I can apprehend.
Here’s a little lesson that I want to send.
I recommend you never lend your favorite pen.  I don’t want to be a meany, sorry to offend.
But isn’t there a way that you can still depend that no one will be sneaky and will not intend to walk away and leave you wondering
WHERE’S MY PEN?  It’s just a simple question that I’ll ask again.
Can anybody tell me 
WHERE’S MY PEN?

<li>That-Pencil-is-Too-Short--Chautauqua-Elementary</li>
                
It was just an ordinary day, when I suddenly heard something strange.
I knew somebody was walking down the hall.
And he had a pencil in his hand and I knew that he did not understand.
The sharpener won’t like it, no not at all.  And I said...That pencil is too short!
That pencil is too short! That pencil is too short!  Then I saw another pencil going by and I’m telling you
I could not believe my eyes.
If she tries to sharpen it, it might get stuck.
So I let her know it was no good, a pencil really ought to have a lot more wood.
Then I sent her on her way and wished her luck.  Cause that pencil is too short!
That pencil is too short! That pencil is too short!  You gotta pay attention when you’re at the machine.
Don’t fall asleep or dawdle and don’t daydream.
Cause pencils disappear if you know what I mean.  I hope you know I’m trying to help you out and tell you all what pencil sharpening is about.
I’d hate to see it if you get you pencil jammed.
Just take a look before you put your pencil in.
Can you be sure that it’ll come back out again?
Listen to me and I think you’ll understand.  That pencil is too short! That pencil is too short!
That pencil is too short!
That pencil is too short! That pencil is too short!
That pencil is too short, that pencil is too short

<li>Rubber-Boots---Chautauqua-Elementary</li>
                
Nothing rhymes with orange,
at least that’s what they say.
I don’t care, got my rubber boots on
Gonna wear them everyday. Nothing rhymes with silver, at least so I’ve been told.
I don’t care, got my rubber boots on
Gonna wear them till I’m old.  Rubber Boots, one for each foot.
Rubber Boots, one for each foot.  Nothing rhymes with month.
I guess that could be true.
I don’t care, got my rubber boots on, don’t you wish you had some too? Nothing rhymes with purple.
Isn’t that too bad?
I don’t care, got my rubber boots on
And my feet are really glad!

Anyone can see you gotta stop the hop

Everyone agrees you gotta stop the hop
Walk along with me and stop the hop

<li>If-the-World-Was-Crazy--Shel-Silverstein</li>
                
If the world was crazy, you know what I'd eat?
A big slice of soup and a whole quart of meat,
A lemonade sandwich, and then I might try
Some roasted ice cream or a bicycle pie,
A nice notebook salad, an underwear roast,
An omelet of hats and some crisp cardboard toast,
A thick malted milk made from pencils and daisies,
And that's what I'd eat if the world was crazy.
If the world was crazy, you know what I'd wear?
A chocolate suit and a tie of eclair,
Some marshmallow earmuffs, some licorice shoes,
And I'd read a paper of peppermint news.
I'd call the boys "Suzy" and I'd call the girls "Harry,"
I'd talk through my ears, and I always would carry
A paper umbrella for when it grew hazy
To keep in the rain, if the world was crazy.
If the world was crazy, you know what I'd do?
I'd walk on the ocean and swim in my shoe,
I'd fly through the ground and I'd skip through the air,
I'd run down the bathtub and bathe on the stair.
When I met somebody I'd say "G'bye, Joe,"
And when I was leaving-then I'd say "Hello."
And the greatest of men would be silly and lazy
So I would be king...if the world was crazy.

<li>Bus-Note--Chautauqua-Elementary</li>
                
You wanna go where? you wanna go how?
You wanna go there and you wanna go now.
You wanna ride easy and you wanna ride fast.
Oh, you’re gonna need a bus note for that. You’re riding uptown to hang out by the pool.
You’re riding down south with your best friend from school.
You’re heading off-island on the ferries that float.
But you won’t get far if you don’t have a note.  Drop by the office and let me explain.
We don’t have a jet and we don’t have a train.
Get up on the bus and don’t you delay.
If you’ve got a note we’re going to drive you away.  You wanna go where? you wanna go how?
You wanna go there and you wanna go now.
You wanna ride easy and you wanna ride fast.
Oh, you’re gonna need a bus note for that.
