You think I'm just an ignorant savage<br />
And you've been so many places; I guess it must be so<br />
But still I cannot see, if the savage one is me<br />
How can there be so much that you don't know?<br />
You don't know...<br />
<br />
You think you own whatever land you land on<br />
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim<br />
But I know every rock and tree and creature<br />
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name.<br />
<br />
You think the only people who are people<br />
Are the people who look and think like you<br />
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger<br />
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew<br />
<br />
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br />
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned<br />
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain<br />
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?<br />
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?<br />
<br />
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest<br />
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth<br />
Come roll in all the riches all around you<br />
And for once never wonder what they're worth<br />
<br />
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers<br />
The heron and the otter are my friends<br />
And we are all connected to each other<br />
In a circle in a loop that never ends<br />
<br />
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br />
Or let the eagle tell you were he�s been<br />
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain<br />
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?<br />
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?<br />
<br />
How high does a sycamore grow?<br />
If you cut it down then you'll never know<br />
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br />
For whether we are white or copper skinned<br />
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain<br />
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind<br />
<br />
You can own the earth and still<br />
All you'll own is earth until<br />
You can paint with all the colours of the wind

Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,<br />
And think of you<br />
Caught up in circles confusion<br />
Is nothing new<br />
Flashback warm nights<br />
Almost left behind<br />
Suitcase of memories,<br />
Time after<br />
<br />
Sometimes you picture me<br />
I'm walking too far ahead<br />
You're calling to me, I can't hear<br />
What you said<br />
Then you say go slow<br />
I fall behind<br />
The second hand unwinds<br />
<br />
If you're lost you can look and you will find me<br />
Time after time<br />
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting<br />
Time after time<br />
<br />
If you're lost you can look and you will find me<br />
Time after time<br />
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting<br />
Time after time<br />
<br />
After my picture fades and darkness has<br />
Turned to gray<br />
Watching through windows you're wondering<br />
If I'm OK<br />
Secrets stolen from deep inside<br />
The drum beats out of time<br />
<br />
If you're lost you can look and you will find me<br />
Time after time<br />
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting<br />
Time after time<br />
<br />
You say go slow<br />
I fall behind<br />
The second hand unwinds<br />
<br />
If you're lost you can look and you will find me<br />
Time after time<br />
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting<br />
Time after time<br />
<br />
If you're lost you can look and you will find me<br />
Time after time<br />
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting<br />
Time after time<br />
<br />
Time after time<br />
Time after time<br />
Time after time

Tale as old as time<br />
True as it can be<br />
Barely even friends<br />
Than somebody bends<br />
Unexpectedly<br />
<br />
Just a little change<br />
Small, to say the least<br />
Both a little scared<br />
Neither one prepared<br />
Beauty and the Beast<br />
<br />
Ever just the same<br />
Ever a surprise<br />
Ever as before<br />
Ever just as sure<br />
As the sun will arise<br />
<br />
Tale as old as time<br />
Tune as old as song<br />
Bittersweet and strange<br />
Finding you can change<br />
Learning you were wrong<br />
<br />
Certain as the sun<br />
Rising in the east<br />
Tale as old as time<br />
Song as old as rhyme<br />
Beauty and the beast

Don't lose your way<br />
With each passing day<br />
You've come so far<br />
Don't throw it away<br />
Live believing<br />
Dreams are for weaving<br />
Wonders are waiting to start<br />
Live your story<br />
Faith, hope & glory<br />
Hold to the truth in your heart<br />
<br />
If we hold on together<br />
I know our dreams will never die<br />
Dreams see us through to forever<br />
Where clouds roll by<br />
For you and I<br />
<br />
Souls in the wind<br />
Must learn how to bend<br />
Seek out a star<br />
Hold on to the end<br />
Valley, mountain<br />
There is a fountain<br />
Washes our tears all away<br />
Words are swaying<br />
Someone is praying<br />
Please let us come home to stay<br />
<br />
If we hold on together<br />
I know our dreams will never die<br />
Dreams see us through to forever<br />
Where clouds roll by<br />
For you and I<br />
<br />
When we are out there in the dark<br />
We'll dream about the sun<br />
In the dark we'll feel the light<br />
Warm our hearts, everyone<br />
<br />
If we hold on together<br />
I know our dreams will never die<br />
Dreams see us through to forever<br />
As high as souls can fly<br />
The clouds roll by<br />
For you and I

This time you’ve really gone too far<br />
So sick of hearing stories<br />
About the new girl hanging around<br />
You’re supposed to be with me<br />
And when I heard the rumour<br />
You kissed her at a party<br />
Like a jealous fool I ran to you<br />
You were still mine<br />
That’s just the way my life goes<br />
Still love me even she knows<br />
You say you’re sorry but you’re not<br />
Et cetera<br />
<br />
<br />
I heard that old song many times<br />
But I still believe you really wanted her<br />
I spent the day deciding should I go or stay<br />
Hoping that the pain would go away<br />
Remember how astounding<br />
It felt to be around me<br />
Extravaganza in the heat<br />
And then the rain came pouring<br />
That’s just the way my life goes<br />
Still love me even she knows<br />
You say you’re sorry but you’re not<br />
Et cetera<br />

I get up, and nothing gets me down.<br />
You got it tough. I've seen the toughest soul around.<br />
And I know, baby, just how you feel.<br />
You've got to roll with the punches to get to what's real<br />
Oh can't you see me standing here,<br />
I've got my back against the record machine<br />
I ain't the worst that you've seen.<br />
Oh can't you see what I mean ?<br />
<br />
Might as well jump. Jump !<br />
Might as well jump.<br />
Go ahead, jump. Jump !<br />
Go ahead, jump.<br />
<br />
Aaa-ohh Hey you ! Who said that ?<br />
Baby how you been ?<br />
You say you don't know, you won't know<br />
until you begin.<br />
Well can't you see me standing here,<br />
I've got my back against the record machine<br />
I ain't the worst that you've seen.<br />
Oh can't you see what I mean ?<br />
<br />
Might as well jump. Jump!<br />
Go ahead, jump.<br />
Might as well jump. Jump!<br />
Go ahead, jump. Jump!<br />

<li>Billy-Joel--Honesty-karaoke</li>
                
If you search for tenderness<br />
it isn't hard to find.<br />
You can have the love you need to live.<br />
But if you look for truthfulness<br />
You might just as well be blind.<br />
It always seems to be so hard to give.<br />
<br />
Honesty is such a lonely word.<br />
Everyone is so untrue.<br />
Honesty is hardly ever heard.<br />
And mostly what I need from you.<br />
<br />
I can always find someone<br />
to say they sympathize.<br />
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve.<br />
But I don't want some pretty face<br />
to tell me pretty lies.<br />
All I want is someone to believe.<br />
<br />
Honesty is such a lonely word.<br />
Everyone is so untrue.<br />
Honesty is hardly ever heard.<br />
And mostly what I need from you.<br />
<br />
I can find a lover.<br />
I can find a friend.<br />
I can have security until the bitter end.<br />
Anyone can comfort me<br />
with promises again.<br />
I know, I know.<br />
<br />
When I'm deep inside of me<br />
don't be too concerned.<br />
I won't as for nothin' while I'm gone.<br />
But when I want sincerity<br />
tell me where else can I turn.<br />
Because you're the one I depend upon.<br />
<br />
Honesty is such a lonely word.<br />
Everyone is so untrue.<br />
Honesty is hardly ever heard.<br />
And mostly what I need from you.<br />

I'll be your dream<br />
I'll be your wish<br />
I'll be your fantasy.<br />
I'll be your hope<br />
I'll be your love<br />
Be everything that you need.<br />
I love you more with every breath<br />
Truly madly deeply do..<br />
I will be strong I will be faithful<br />
'Cos I'm counting on a new beginning.<br />
A reason for living.<br />
A deeper meaning.<br />
Chorus<br />
<br />
I want to stand with you on a mountain.<br />
I want to bathe with you in the sea.<br />
I want to lay like this forever.<br />
Until the sky falls down on me...<br />
<br />
<br />
And when the stars are shining brightly<br />
In the velvet sky,<br />
I'll make a wish<br />
Send it to heaven<br />
Then make you want to cry..<br />
The tears of joy<br />
For all the pleasure and the certainty.<br />
That we're surrounded<br />
By the comfort and protection of..<br />
The highest power.<br />
In lonely hours.<br />
The tears devour you..<br />
I want to stand with you on a mountain,<br />
I want to bathe with you in the sea.<br />
I want to lay like this forever,<br />
Until the sky falls down on me...<br />
Bridge<br />
<br />
Oh can't you see it baby?<br />
You don't have to close your eyes<br />
'Cos it's standing right before you.<br />
All that you need will surely come...<br />
<br />
I'll be your dream<br />
I'll be your wish<br />
I'll be your fantasy.<br />
I'll be your hope<br />
I'll be your love<br />
Be everything that you need.<br />
I'll love you more with every breath<br />
Truly madly deeply do...<br />

I got my first real six-string<br />
Bought it at the five-and-dime<br />
Played it 'till my fingers bled<br />
Was the summer of 69<br />
<br />
Me and some guys from school<br />
Had a band and we tried real hard<br />
Jimmy quit and Joey got married<br />
Shoulda known we'd never get far<br />
<br />
Oh when I look back now<br />
That summer seemed to last forever<br />
And if I had the choice<br />
Yeah - I'd always wanna be there<br />
Those were the best days of my life<br />
<br />
Ain't no use in complainin'<br />
When you got a job to do<br />
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in<br />
And that's when I met you yeah<br />
<br />
Standin' on your Mama's porch<br />
You told me that you'd wait forever<br />
Oh and when you held my hand<br />
I knew that it was now or never<br />
Those were the best days of my life<br />
Back in the summer of 69<br />
<br />
Man we were killin' time<br />
We were young and restless<br />
We needed to unwind<br />
I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no,yeah<br />
<br />
And now the times are changin'<br />
Look at everything that's come and gone<br />
Sometimes when I play that old six-string<br />
I think about you, wonder what went wrong<br />
<br />
Standin' on your Mama's porch<br />
You told me that it'd last forever<br />
Oh when you held my hand<br />
I knew that it was now or never<br />
Those were the best days of my life, oh yeah<br />
Back in the summer of 69,uh-huh<br />
It was the summer of 69,o yeah, me n my baby in 69<br />
It was the summer, the summer, summer of 69
