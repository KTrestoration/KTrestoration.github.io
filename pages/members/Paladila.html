Chorus:<br />
Rhythym is a dancer,<br />
it's a soul's companion,<br />
you can feel it everywhere<br />
<br />
Lift your hands and voices<br />
free your mind and join us<br />
you can feel it in the air<br />
<br />
Ooh, it's a passion<br />
Ooh, you can feel it in the air<br />
Ooh, it's a passion<br />
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh<br />
<br />
chorus<br />
<br />
A far away light in the futuristic place we might be,<br />
It's a tiny world just big enough to support the kingdom of one<br />
knowledgeable,<br />
throw away the loneliness and head back down,<br />
I'm going too fast, I'm going too fast<br />
<br />
chorus<br />
<br />
I plunge right on through the office door,<br />
and into the arms of the bottomless negro of love,<br />
suddenly I can't remember,<br />
how to stop, or turn around,<br />
<br />
Do I have to get behind myself,<br />
Do I have to turn around before I can point,<br />
I flip 'til I can breathe

<li>De-Juniors-zingen-Heyo</li>
                
Heyo, da's de korte maar bijzonder krachtige titel van het themalied van Junior Eurosong. Het nummer werd geschreven door Peter Gillis, de man achter de knoppen bij zowat elke plaat van K3. Dit jaar dus geen Gene Thomas of X!nk: de juniors zingen het lied van de eerste tot de laatste noot zelf. Resultaat = een knaller van formaat!<br />
<br />
Met een refrein dat langer blijft plakken dan een opgedroogde kauwgom onder uw nieuwe schoen wordt Heyo zonder twijfel een instant-meezinger. Het lied gaat over hoe graag de kandidaten op een podium staan en mensen entertainen, en over hun tomeloze liefde voor muziek. De single 'Heyo' ligt nu in de winkel.<br />

LYRICS<br />
<br />
He steps on the floor without making a sound<br />
Then he starts feeling the beat<br />
You would think the floor was greased<br />
By the way he's moving his feet<br />
<br />
(begin chorus)<br />
He's a champion<br />
He is the best<br />
Impossible to tame<br />
People say that he's obsessed<br />
Listen to the sound of his name<br />
They call him Flash- Flash- Flash- Flash- Flaaaashbeagle<br />
When he goes around the whole room starts to reel<br />
You know he's Flash- Flash- Flash- Flash- Flaaaashbeagle<br />
When he jumps up high he glides like a wild eagle (end chorus)<br />
<br />
Lightning flashes when he leaps up<br />
He's got everybody shouting for more<br />
Thunder crashes when he hits the ground<br />
He's burning up the dancin' floor<br />
<br />
(repeat chorus)<br />
<br />
From the fur on his feet to the tip of his nose<br />
He's got rhythym pumping all through his veins<br />
He spins like a top that'll never stop<br />
With the power of a hurricane

It's the greatest time of year, and it's here<br />
Help me celebrate it<br />
With everybody here, friends so dear<br />
Let me simply state it<br />
It's our favourite way to spend the holiday<br />
Yeah<br />
<br />
There's a special kind of feeling in the air<br />
It only happens at this time of year<br />
When everyone is filled with love and cheer<br />
'Cause that's what matters<br />
<br />
Pretty paper boxes tied with bows<br />
Walking in the sun or in the snow<br />
We can feel the excitement growing, growing<br />
<br />
It's the greatest time of year, and it's here<br />
Help me celebrate it<br />
With everybody here, friends so dear<br />
Let me simply state it<br />
Joy to the world and everyone<br />
Lift up your hearts and feel the love<br />
It's our favourite way, to spend the holiday<br />
Yeah<br />
<br />
We can get all cozy by the fire<br />
Turn the music up a little higher<br />
I don't think that I could ever tire<br />
Of being together<br />
<br />
Decorate the tree, hang mistletoe<br />
And stand by me<br />
<br />
It's a picture perfect moment captured<br />
Memories that we'll have after<br />
<br />
It's the greatest time of year, and it's here<br />
Help me celebrate it<br />
With everybody here, friends so dear<br />
Let me simply state it<br />
Joy to the world and everyone<br />
Lift up your hearts and feel the love<br />
It's our favourite way, to spend the holiday<br />
Yeah<br />
<br />
Spend the holidays...<br />
<br />
It's the greatest time<br />
<br />
It's the greatest time of year, and it's here<br />
Help me celebrate it<br />
With everybody here, friends so dear<br />
Let me simply state it<br />
Joy to the world<br />
Joy to the world<br />
Joy to the world<br />
It's the greatest time of year<br />
It's the greatest time<br />

It's the greatest time of year, and it's here<br />

<li>Ed-Edd-n-Eddy-Kingdom-Hearts-Style-2</li>
                
the sequel in the 'ed edd n eddy:kingdom hearts style' saga!! unlike the last one, it was a huge success when it came to making it... anyway, this one has a hip-hop beat, i added it in for a filler, the song is from 'the (white) rapper show', i dont know which episode.<br />
<br />
like i said in the last video, more parts would be revealed in later movies! in this one, there are also:<br />
kevin-riku<br />
nazz-kairi<br />
rolf-axel<br />
...the kankers' specific parts are the only main parts left, and i hope to reveal their parts in 'ed edd n eddy:kingdom hearts style 3!!!!!'<br />
<br />
on the rap part, here are the parts (i dont know the real rappers' names):<br />
hook rapper-sora<br />
female rapper-kairi<br />
male rapper-axel<br />
special guest appearances by: peewee herman and jerry lewis (thanx a bunch!)<br />
...that's all!<br />
on the 'memorable moments', i accidently put 'sora' instead of 'ed', sorry i was in a hurry, just pretend it says 'ed'.<br />
<br />
i dont own ed edd n eddy, kingdom hearts, kingdom hearts 2, kingdom hearts COM, the (white) rapper show, the song from the (white) rapper show, pucca, noddle, sora, gorillaz, or candy love. thanks goes to khvids.net for the videos and download links, and thanks to filefront.net for the actual downloads.<br />
<br />
p.s. all strange pictures in this video (not jerry lewis or peewee herman) were made by moi in photoshop. id have recorded how i did it and uploaded it, but i dont have that software to record activity on your computer, and i dont want the hassles of a video camera. so sorry...

Far longer than forever<br />
I'll hold you in my heart<br />
It's almost like you're here with me<br />
Although we're far apart<br />
<br />
Far longer than forever<br />
As constant as a star<br />
I close my eyes and I am where you are<br />
<br />
Sure as the dawn brings the sunrise<br />
We've an unshakable bond<br />
Destined to last for a lifetime and beyond<br />
<br />
Far longer than forever (Far longer than forever)<br />
Like no love every known<br />
And with your love I'll never be alone<br />
<br />
Far longer than forever (Far longer than forever)<br />
Like no love every known<br />
And with your love I'll never be alone<br />
<br />
Far longer than forever<br />
Much stronger than forever<br />
And with your love I'll never be alone<br />
<br />
Never, never be alone<br />
Never, never be alone<br />
Far longer than forever<br />
<br />
I knew that we belonged together<br />
Long before I knew your name<br />
And the only thing I longed for<br />
Was a sign to prove you felt the same<br />
<br />
Somehow I knew your every secret<br />
Just by looking in your eyes<br />
From the very moment I met you<br />
I was thinking of the rest of our lives<br />
<br />
Just say to me<br />
<br />
I'm gonna love you 'til the end of the time<br />
Somehow two hearts have made a friend of time<br />
Eternity, eternity is on our side<br />
<br />
I'm not afraid to say forever<br />
You have made me feel so sure<br />
'Cause I know it's everlasting<br />
And I've never had this feeling before<br />
<br />
Keep telling me<br />
<br />
I'm gonna love you 'til the end of time<br />
Somehow two hearts have made a friend of time<br />
Eternity, I'll love you for eternity<br />
<br />
Caught in the tide<br />
And it brought me to you<br />
And now I know that dreams come true<br />
<br />
I'm gonna love you 'til the end of time<br />
Somehow two hearts have made a friend of time<br />
Eternity, eternity, is on our side<br />
<br />
I'm gonna love you 'til the end of time<br />
Somehow two hearts have made a friend of time<br />
Eternity, eternity, is on our side (is on our side)<br />
<br />
I'm gonna love 'til the end of time ('til the end of time)<br />
Somehow two hearts have made a friend of time<br />
Eternity, eternity, is on our side<br />
Eternity, I'll love you for eternity

<li>If-We-Hold-On-Together--The-Land-Before-Time</li>
                
Forever Diana Musical Memoirs<br />
If We Hold On Together<br />
don't lose your way<br />
With each passing day<br />
You've come so far<br />
Don't throw it away<br />
Live believing<br />
Dreams are for weaving<br />
Wonders are waiting to start<br />
Live your story<br />
Faith, hope & glory<br />
Hold to the truth in your heart<br />
<br />
If we hold on together<br />
I know our dreams will never die<br />
Dreams see us through to forever<br />
Where clouds roll by<br />
For you and i<br />
<br />
Souls in the wind<br />
Must learn how to bend<br />
Seek out a star<br />
Hold on to the end<br />
Valley, mountain<br />
[ Diana Ross Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]<br />
There is a fountain<br />
Washes our tears all away<br />
Words are swaying<br />
Somebody is praying<br />
Please let us come home to stay<br />
<br />
If we hold on together<br />
I know our dreams will never die<br />
Dreams see us through to forever<br />
Where clouds roll by<br />
For you and i<br />
<br />
When we are out there in the dark<br />
We'll dream about the sun<br />
In the dark we'll feel the light<br />
Warm our hearts, everyone<br />
<br />
If we hold on together<br />
I know our dreams will never die<br />
Dreams see us through to forever<br />
As high as souls can fly<br />
The clouds roll by<br />
For you and i

I never felt nothing in the world like this before<br />
Now I'm missing you<br />
& I'm wishing that you would come back through my door<br />
Why did you have to go? You could have let me know<br />
So now I'm all alone,<br />
Girl you could have stayed<br />
but you wouldnt give me a chance<br />
With you not around it's a little bit more then i can stand<br />
And all my tears they keep running down my face<br />
Why did you turn away?<br />
<br />
[Bridge]<br />
<br />
So why does your pride make you run and hide?<br />
Are you that afraid of me?<br />
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside<br />
This is not how you wanted to be<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
So baby I will wait for you<br />
Cause I don''t know what else i can do<br />
Don't tell me I ran out of time<br />
If it takes the rest of my life<br />
<br />
Baby I will wait for you<br />
If you think I'm fine it just aint true<br />
I really need you in my life<br />
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you<br />
<br />
[Verse 2]<br />
<br />
It's been a long time since you called me<br />
(How could you forget about me)<br />
You got me feeling crazy (crazy)<br />
How can you walk away,<br />
Everything stays the same<br />
I just can't do it baby<br />
What will it take to make you come back<br />
Girl I told you what it is & it just ain't like that<br />
Why can't you look at me, your still in love with me<br />
Don't leave me crying.<br />
<br />
[Bridge]<br />
<br />
Baby why can't we just start over again<br />
Get it back to the way it was<br />
If you give me a chance I can love you right<br />
But your telling me it wont be enough<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
So baby I will wait for you<br />
Cause I don''t know what else i can do<br />
Don't tell me I ran out of time<br />
If it takes the rest of my life<br />
<br />
Baby I will wait for you<br />
If you think I'm fine it just aint true<br />
I really need you in my life<br />
No matter what i have to do I'll wait for you<br />
<br />
[Bridge]<br />
<br />
So why does you pride make you run & hide<br />
Are you that afriad of me?<br />
But I know it's a lie what your keeping inside<br />
Thats not how you wanted to be<br />
<br />
Baby I will wait for you<br />
Baby I will wait for you<br />
If it's the last thing i do<br />
<br />
[Chorus]<br />
<br />
Baby I will wait for you<br />
Cause I don''t know what else i can do<br />

We're talking away<br />
I don't know what<br />
I'm to say I'll say it anyway<br />
Today's another day to find you<br />
Shying away<br />
I'll be coming for your love, OK?<br />
<br />
Take on me, take me on<br />
I'll be gone<br />
In a day or two<br />
<br />
So needless to say<br />
I'm odds and ends<br />
But that's me stumbling away<br />
Slowly learning that life is OK.<br />
Say after me<br />
It's no better to be safe than sorry<br />
<br />
Take on me, take me on<br />
I'll be gone<br />
In a day or two<br />
<br />
Oh the things that you say<br />
Is it life or<br />
Just a play my worries away<br />
You're all the things I've got to<br />
remember<br />
You're shying away<br />
I'll be coming for you anyway<br />
<br />
Take on me, take me on<br />
I'll be gone<br />
In a day or two<br />

Terrify their neighborhood.<br />

But Heathcliff just won't be undone<br />
<br />
Playing pranks on everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a race to be on top.<br />
<br />
The competition doesn't stop.<br />
<br />
Mixing with the ladies fair<br />
<br />
Being charming, debonair.<br />
<br />
<br />
The gang will reign supreme<br />
<br />
And no one can deny-y-y-y.<br />
<br />
They’ll make some history<br />
<br />
And always have an alibi-i.<br />
<br />
<br />
So join in the jubilee<br />
<br />
The cats are great, they’ll all agree.<br />

Find in each calamity<br />
<br />
The cats superiority.<br />

Terrify their neighborhood.<br />

You should realize he can win it with you!

I'll make a wish send it to heaven<br />
That'll make you wanna cry<br />
The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty<br />
That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection<br />
Of the highest power and lonely hours<br />
The tears divide you<br />
<br />
I wanna stand with you on a mountain<br />
I wanna bathe with you in the sea<br />
I wanna lay like this forever<br />
Until the sky falls down on me<br />
<br />
Oh, can't you see it baby?<br />
Don't have to close your eyes<br />
'cause it's standing right before you<br />
All that you need will surely come<br />
<br />
I'll be your dream<br />
I'll be your wish<br />
I'll be your fantasy<br />
I'll be your hope<br />
I'll be your love<br />
Be everything that you need<br />
I love you more with every breath<br />
Truly, madly, deeply, do..<br />
<br />
I wanna stand with you on a mountain<br />
I wanna bathe with you in the sea<br />
I wanna lay like this forever<br />
Until the sky falls down on me<br />
<br />
I wanna stand with you on a mountain<br />
I wanna bathe with you in the sea<br />
I want to lay like this forever<br />
Until the sky falls down on me<br />
<br />
(I wanna stand with you on a mountain<br />
I wanna bathe with you in the sea<br />
I want to lay like this forever<br />
Until the sky falls down on me)<br />

I lose my way, no one cares.<br />
The words I say, no one hears.<br />
My life it seems<br />
Is a world of dreams.<br />
<br />
Deep in the night, you'll find me.<br />
Dream and you're right behind me.<br />
Stay if you will stay<br />
We'll dream the night away.<br />
<br />
Dreams to dream in the dark of the night<br />
When the world goes wrong, I can still make it right<br />
I can see so far in my dreams<br />
I'll follow my dreams<br />
Until they come true.<br />
<br />
There is a star waiting to guide us<br />
Shining inside us when we close our eyes!<br />
Come with me, you will see what I mean,<br />
There's a world inside no one else ever sees.<br />
You will go so far in my dreams,<br />
Somewhere in my dreams,<br />
Your dreams will come true.<br />
<br />
Don�t let go, if you stay close to me<br />
In my dreams tonight, you will see what I see<br />
Dreams to dream, as near as can be<br />
Inside you and me, that always come true,<br />
Inside you and me, that always come true.<br />

You think you own whatever land you land on<br />
Earth is just a dead thing you can claim<br />
But I know every rock and tree and creature<br />
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name<br />
<br />
You think the only people who are people<br />
Are the people who look and think like you<br />
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger<br />
You learn things you never knew<br />
You never knew<br />
<br />
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?<br />
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grinned<br />
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?<br />
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?<br />
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?<br />
<br />
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest<br />
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth<br />
Come roll in all the riches all around you<br />
And for once never wonder what they're worth<br />
<br />
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers<br />
And the heron and the otter are my friends<br />
And we are all connected to each other<br />
In a circle in a hoop that never ends<br />
<br />
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?<br />
or let the eagle tell you where hes been<br />
can you sing with all the voices of the mountain<br />
can you paint with all the colors of the wind<br />
can you paint with all the colors of the wind<br />
<br />
<br />
How high does the sycamore grow<br />
If you cut it down, then you'll never know<br />
<br />
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon<br />
For whether we are white or copper - skinned<br />
We just sing with all the voices of the mountain<br />
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind<br />
<br />
You can own the earth and still<br />
All you'll own is earth until<br />
You can paint with all colors of the wind.<br />

Simba: Jeg blir en konge uten frykt <br />
med krefter som får slå. <br />
<br />
Zazu: Jeg har aldri sett en konge før som har så lite hår. <br />
<br />
Simba: Jeg blir en konge uten sans <br />
for maset fra en knøl. <br />
Jeg øver på å skue ned, <br />
jeg trener på mitt brøl! <br />
<br />
Zazu: Men så langt så er det ikke ditt problem. <br />
<br />
Simba: Bare vent snart blir jeg majestet! <br />
<br />
Zazu: Du har ennå en marsj her, unge mann! Hvis du tror at...! <br />
<br />
Simba: Ingen sier 'kom hit,' <br />
Zazu: Altså, det jeg sa var at... <br />
Nala: Ingen sier 'vær der,' <br />
Zazu: Det jeg mente var at... <br />
Simba: Ingen sier 'hold opp,' <br />
Zazu: Men det du ikke skjønner, er at... <br />
Simba & Nala: Ingen sier 'hør her!' <br />
Zazu: Nei hør her! <br />
Simba: Jeg kan løpe som en pil. <br />
Zazu: Det er å handle for fort. <br />
Simba: Jeg kan gjør hva jeg vil. <br />
<br />
Zazu: Jeg tror at du og jeg bør ta en prat på tomannshånd <br />
Simba: Råd fra grettne nesehornfugler det er bare bånn. <br />
Zazu: Hvis monarkiet skal bli sånn, da trekker jeg meg ut! <br />
Ut av jobben, ut av Afrika. Da er det faktisk slutt. <br />
Jeg har fått nok av impulsivitet! <br />
<br />
Simba: Bare vent snart blir jeg majestet! <br />
<br />
Simba: Alle vender helt om. <br />
Zazu: Hva?! <br />
Simba: Kjenner de må gyse. <br />
Venter spent på han som <br />
står i rampelyset. <br />
Zazu: Ikke ennå! <br />

Chorus: De jubler for den arvingen du vet. <br />
Og danser med stor virtuositet. <br />
Velsigner Simbas kongeverdighet. <br />

Bare vent snart blir jeg majestet! <br />
Bare vent snart blir jeg...... majestet!

Jeg ser hva som kommer (hva?!) <br />
Det vil de neppe tro (hvem?!) <br />
De blir et par, og resultatet er <br />
Vår trio blir til to (åh) <br />
I skumringsøyeblikket <br />
Med trolldom over alt <br />
Da blir det så romantisk skal du se <br />
at dette ender galt! <br />
<br />
Fyll ditt sinn med kjærlighet <br />
La Amors piler fly <br />
Naturens sang <br />
Og himlens stjernedryss <br />
Gir liv til alt på ny <br />
<br />
Simba <br />
<br />
Jeg vil så gjerne si det, <br />
Men hva vil hun forstå <br />
Alt det som jeg har gjort? Det går ikke! <br />
Da vil hun bare gå <br />
<br />
Nala <br />
<br />
Han skjuler noe for meg, <br />
Jeg aner ikke hva <br />
og hvorfor vil han aldri mere bli <br />
Den kongen vi vil ha?! <br />
<br />
Fyll ditt sinn med kjærlighet <br />
La Amors piler fly <br />
Naturens sang, <br />
Og himlens stjernedryss <br />
Gir liv til alt på ny <br />
<br />
Fyll ditt sinn med kjærlighet <br />
Ta hjertet med på alt <br />
gi deg hen <br />
Og spinn til livets vev <br />
Kjærlighetens tråd <br />
<br />
Timon og Pumbaa <br />
<br />
Og hvis de blir et par i natt (snufs) <br />
Kan det sies kjapt <br />
At vår tid sammen er historie <br />
Da er vår venn fortapt! <br />

Timon og Pumbaa gråter

I can see what's happening What?<br />
<br />
And they don't have a clue Who?<br />
<br />
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line<br />
<br />
Our trio's down to two. Oh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The sweet caress of twilight<br />
<br />
There's magic everywhere<br />
<br />
And with all this romantic atmosphere<br />
<br />
Disaster's in the air<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you feel the love tonight<br />
<br />
The peace the evening brings<br />
<br />
The world for once in perfect harmony<br />
<br />
With all its living things<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So many things to tell her<br />
<br />
But how to make her see<br />
<br />
The truth about my past, impossible<br />
<br />
She'd turn away from me<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He's holding back, he's hiding<br />
<br />
But what, I can't decide<br />
<br />
Why won't he be the king I know he is?<br />
<br />
The king I see inside?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you feel the love tonight?<br />
<br />
The peace the evening brings<br />
<br />
The world, for once, in perfect harmony<br />
<br />
With all its living things<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you feel the love tonight?<br />
<br />
You needn't look too far<br />
<br />
Stealing through the night's uncertainties<br />
<br />
Love is where they are<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And if he feels the love tonight<br />
<br />
In the way I do<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's enough for this restless wanderer<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to be with you

I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!<br />
<br />
	I've never seen a king of beasts<br />
	With quite so little hair<br />
<br />
I'm gonna be the mane event<br />
Like no king was before<br />
I'm brushing up on looking down<br />
I'm working on my roar<br />
<br />
	Thus far a rather uninspiring thing<br />
<br />
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!<br />
<br />
No one saying do this		Now when I said that--<br />
No one saying be there		What I meant was--<br />
No one saying stop that		What you don't realize--<br />
No one saying see here		Now see here!<br />
Free to run around all day	That's definitely out--<br />
Free to do it all my way!<br />
<br />
I think it's time that you and I<br />
Arranged a heart-to-heart<br />
<br />
Kings don't need advice<br />
From little hornbills for a start<br />
<br />
If this is where the monarchy is headed<br />
Count me out<br />
Out of service, out of Africa<br />
I wouldn't hang about<br />
This child is getting wildly out of wing<br />
<br />
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!<br />
Everybody look left<br />
<br />
Everybody look right<br />
<br />
Everywhere you look I'm--<br />
<br />
Standing in the spotlight<br />
<br />
Not yet<br />
<br />
Let every creature go for broke and sing<br />
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing<br />
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling<br />
<br />
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!<br />
<br />
Oh, he just can't wait to be king!<br />
<br />
Oh, I just can't wait...<br />
<br />
Just can't wait<br />
<br />
To be king!<br />

SWEDISH - LYRICS <br />
<br />
Jag känner en bot, hon heter Anna, Anna heter hon<br />
Och hon kan banna, banna dig så hårt<br />
Hon röjer upp i våran kanal<br />
Jag vill berätta för dig, att jag känner en bot<br />
<br />

Och hon kan banna, banna dig så hårt<br />
Hon röjer upp i våran kanal<br />
Jag vill berätta för dig, att jag känner en bot<br />
<br />
Som alltid vaktar alla som är här<br />
Och som ser till att vi blir utan besvär<br />
Det finns ingen take-over som lyckas<br />
Kom ihåg att det är jag som känner en bot<br />
<br />
En bott som ingen, ingen annan slår<br />
Och hon kan kicka utan att du får<br />
Hon gör sig av med alla som spammar<br />
Ja, inget kan slå våran bott<br />
<br />
(Ready for take off)<br />

Och hon kan banna, banna dig så hårt<br />
Hon röjer upp i våran kanal<br />
Jag vill berätta för dig att jag känner en bot<br />
<br />
Då kom den dagen, jag inte trodde fanns,<br />
det satte verkligen kanalen ur balans<br />
Jag trodde aldrig att jag hade så fel<br />
Men när Anna skrev och sa:<br />
'Jag är ingen bot<br />
Jag är en väldigt, väldigt vacker tjej'<br />
Som nu tyvärr är väldigt främmande för mig<br />
Men det finns inget som behöver förklaras<br />
För i mina ögon är hon alltid en bot<br />
<br />
Jag känner en bot, hon heter Anna, Anna heter hon<br />

ENGLISH - LYRICS<br />
<br />
I know a cure, <br />
her name is Anna, Anna is her name <br />
And she can ban, ban you so hard <br />
She cleans up in our channel <br />
I wanna tell you, that I know a cure <br />
<br />
I know a cure, <br />
her name is Anna, Anna is her name <br />
And she can ban, ban you so hard <br />
She cleans up in our channel <br />
I wanna tell you, that I know a cure <br />
<br />
That always watches everyone here <br />
And makes us out of trouble <br />
There is no Take-over that succeeds <br />
Remember that it's I who know this cure <br />
<br />
The bot that no one else can beat <br />
And she kicks even if she shouldn't <br />
She gets rid of everyone that 'spams' <br />
Yes, nothing can beat our cure <br />
<br />
(Ready for take off) <br />
<br />
(Are you ready?) <br />
<br />
And then came the day I didn't think was real <br />
The channel was out of control <br />
I never thought I would be so wrong <br />
When Anna said to me <br />
'I'm not a cure, <br />
I'm a really beautiful girl' <br />
Which is, unluckily, now very strange to me <br />
But nothing needs to be explained <br />
*Because in my eyes, you will always be a cure* <br />
<br />
Her name is Anna, Anna is her name <br />
And she can ban, ban you so hard <br />
She cleans up in our channel <br />
I wanna tell you, that I know a cure <br />
<br />
That always watches everyone here <br />
And makes us out of trouble <br />
There is no Take-over that succeeds <br />
Remember that it's I who know this cure <br />

(Refrain)<br />
Here we are, going far, to save all that we love;<br />
If we give, all we've got, we will make it through.<br />
Here we are, like a star, shining bright on your world;<br />
Today, make Evil go away!<br />
<br />
Code Lyoko, we'll reset it all.<br />
Code Lyoko, be there when you call!<br />
Code Lyoko, we will stand real tall.<br />
Code Lyoko, stronger after all!<br />
<br />
A world of machines, it can shadow human nature.<br />
And all that we need, is the way to find the answer.<br />
But one thing is sure, you can count on us for good!<br />
<br />
(Refain)<br />
<br />
Code Lyoko, we'll reset it all.<br />
Code Lyoko, be there when you call.<br />
Code Lyoko, we will stand real tall.<br />
Code Lyoko, stronger after all!<br />
<br />
We'll do our best, to never let you down.<br />
We're up to the test, to turn this world around!

Vamos a jugar a un juego nuevo<br />
Que se llama el mundo al revés<br />
<br />
Uso la sartén para jugar al tenis<br />
Y la tostadora para ver mis pelis<br />
Voy a cambiar<br />
Todo lo que hay alrededor<br />
<br />
Guardo mis CD's en el lavavajillas<br />
Ahora son las discos toda la cocina<br />
Y para entrar, hay que bailar esta canción<br />
<br />
No lo intentes en tu casa<br />
Que resulta peligroso<br />
Que no vivo de verdad<br />
Y aunque todo estoy haciendo<br />
En el fondo me divierto<br />
Porque aqui nada es real<br />
<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Nada es lo que crees<br />
Dejando volar imaginación<br />
Viviendo la ventura en el salón<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Tu vas a aprender<br />
Y en casa hay mil maneras<br />
De pasar lo bien<br />
<br />
Vamos al salón que ahora es una selva<br />
Monta una cabaña debajo de la mesa<br />
Y cojo el secador para cazar algún león<br />
Súbete al sofá salta un poco más<br />
Guerra de cojines me lo paso genial!<br />
Y ya veras como nos pille aquí mamá<br />
<br />
No lo intentes en tu casa<br />
Que resulta peligroso<br />
Que no vivo de verdad<br />
Y aunque todo estoy haciendo<br />
En el fondo me divierto<br />
Porque aqui nada es real<br />
<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Nada es lo que crees<br />
Dejando volar imaginación<br />
Viviendo la ventura en el salón<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Tu vas a aprender<br />
Y en casa hay mil maneras<br />
De pasar lo bien<br />
<br />
Ahora todo el mundo<br />
Con una mano arriba<br />
Cuida con el ralao<br />
Que no te haga cosquillas<br />
Un paso hacia delante<br />
Y un salto para atrás<br />
Y luego media vuelta y a empezar<br />
<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Nada es lo que crees<br />
Dejando volar imaginación<br />
Viviendo la ventura en el salón<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Tu vas a aprender<br />
Y en casa hay mil maneras<br />
De pasar lo bien<br />
<br />
Todo es una locura<br />
No te pierdas la aventura<br />
Vamos todos a jugar<br />
Haz lo que te de la gana<br />
Ya lo limpiarás mañana<br />
Que la fiesta va a empezar<br />
<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Nada es lo que crees<br />
Dejando volar imaginación<br />
Viviendo la ventura en el salón<br />
En el mundo al revés<br />
Tu vas a aprender<br />
Y en casa hay mil maneras<br />
De pasar lo bien

I'll be your dream I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy I'll be your hope I'll be your love Be everything that you need. I love you more with every breath Truly, madly, deeply, do..  I will be strong I will be faithful Because I am counting on a new beginning A reason for living A deeper meaning yeah  I wanna stand with you on a mountain I wanna bathe with you in the sea I wanna lay like this forever Until the sky falls down on me  And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky I'll make a wish send it to heaven That'll make you wanna cry The tears of joy for all the pleasure and the certainty That we're surrounded by the comfort and protection Of the highest power and lonely hours The tears divide you  I wanna stand with you on a mountain I wanna bathe with you in the sea I wanna lay like this forever Until the sky falls down on me  Oh, can't you see it baby? Don't have to close your eyes 'cause it's standing right before you All that you need will surely come  I'll be your dream I'll be your wish I'll be your fantasy I'll be your hope I'll be your love Be everything that you need I love you more with every breath Truly, madly, deeply, do..

This is the Introduction to Super Smash bros Melee on Gamecube. It was perfect quality before i put it on but its been compressed slightly and looks slightly pixellated (is that how you spell it?). I recorded it onto a dvd. Oh yeah, Just so you know, I did'nt MAKE This game. NINTENDO did. So no copyright issues!

Why exactly was that weird wire thing sticking out of the ground?<br />
<br />
Also, I thought that statue had like fifty bajillion HP. Then Ness kills it with just two attacks?

I love the Mother series. I played a small bit of Earthbound a while ago and loved it, but that was back when I used emulation like a jerkface. But I discovered a game came before it, and I ALWAYS play games in a series in order. So I'm currently playing through Earthbound Zero on my PSP (hey, the game was never released, I think that would make emulation acceptable).

If I never knew you<br />
If I never felt this love<br />
I would have no inkling of<br />
How precious life can be<br />
<br />
And if I never held you<br />
I would never have a clue<br />
How at last I'd find in you<br />
The missing part of me<br />
<br />
In this world so full of fear<br />
Full of rage and lies<br />
I can see the truth so clear<br />
In your eyes<br />
So dry your eyes<br />
<br />
And I'm so grateful to you<br />
I'd have lived my whole life through<br />
Lost forever<br />
If I never knew you<br />
<br />
<br />
If I never knew you<br />
I'd be safe but half as real<br />
Never knowing I could feel<br />
A love so strong and true<br />
<br />
I'm so grateful to you<br />
I'd have lived my whole life through<br />
Lost forever<br />
If I never knew you<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought our love would be so beautiful<br />
<br />
<br />
Somehow we made the whole world bright<br />
<br />
<br />
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong<br />
All they'd leave us where these whispers in the night<br />
But still my heart is singing<br />
We were right<br />
<br />
<br />
If I never knew you<br />
If I never knew this love<br />
I would have no inkling of<br />
How precious life can be<br />
<br />
<br />
There's no moment I regret<br />
Since the moment that we met<br />
If our time has gone too fast<br />
I've lived at last...<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought our love would be so beautiful<br />
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought our love would be so beautiful<br />
We'd turn the darkness into light<br />
<br />
<br />
And still my heart is singing<br />
We were right<br />
<br />
<br />
We were right<br />
And If I never knew you<br />
I'd have lived my whole life through<br />
<br />
<br />
Empty as the sky<br />
<br />
<br />
Never knowing why<br />
Lost forever<br />
If I never knew you

Jeg har ofte gått og tenkt på<br />
hva det var jeg gjorde galt<br />
tenkt på alt jeg ikke fikk fortalt<br />
Det er så mye jeg ville gi deg<br />
det er så mye jeg skulle ha gjort<br />
Men tida gikk så alt for fort<br />
Du er det beste som har hendt meg<br />
og det kjæreste jeg har<br />
Ingen kan ta fra oss det vi har<br />
For kjærligheten kommer og kjærligheten går<br />
men det vi hadde sammen skal bestå<br />
<br />
Om det skulle blåse kaldt<br />
Om jeg leter overalt<br />
Ingen er så god som du<br />
Du er det vakreste som fins<br />
Om det skulle blåse kaldt<br />
Om jeg aldri fikk fortalt<br />
At ingen er så god som du<br />
Du er det vakreste som fins for meg.....<br />
<br />
Var så godt å være nær deg<br />
Og på havet som en venn<br />
Å jeg lengter etter varmen din igjen<br />
Var så fint å være sammen<br />
Og du smilte da du dro<br />
Dine øyne sa meg mer enn du forsto<br />
Det fins håp i alt du tenker<br />
Det fins håp i alt du gjør<br />
I mitt liv er du et lys som aldri dør<br />
<br />
Om det skulle blåse kaldt<br />
Om jeg leter overalt<br />
Ingen er så god som du<br />
Du er det vakreste som fins<br />
Om det skulle blåse kaldt<br />
Om jeg aldri fikk fortalt<br />
At ingen er så god som du<br />
Du er det vakreste som fins for meg<br />
<br />
Vi skal kjempe sammen for de drømmene vi har<br />
Vi skal finne mange nye med svar<br />
Og bålet som vi tente det skal aldri brenne ned<br />
Og jeg veit at vi kan holde liv i det<br />
<br />
Om det skulle blåse kaldt<br />
Om jeg leter overalt<br />
Ingen er så god som du<br />
Du er det vakreste som fins<br />
Om det skulle blåse kaldt<br />
Om jeg aldri fikk fortalt<br />
At ingen er så god som du<br />
Du er det vakreste som fins for meg

Those boys are always up to something,<br />
And its bringing me to tears cause,<br />
Just before you get home it mgically disappears.<br />
<br />
*Chorus*<br />
Those boys are evil,<br />
But before you get home them somehow clean up the mess,<br />
Those boys are evil,<br />
Let me spell out for you mama,<br />
E.V.I.L.B.O.Y.S .<br />
<br />
They built a rollercoaster,<br />
And a beach in the backyard,<br />
Drove cattle throughout the city,<br />
And they messed up the boulevard,<br />
They took me back in time when we went to that museum,<br />
They built 50 feet tree house robots,<br />
But still you didn't see them.<br />
<br />
*Chorus*<br />
Those boys are evil,<br />
Those crazy shmanicans caused me all kinds of dis-stress,<br />
Those boys are evil,<br />
Sing it with me,<br />
(E.V.I.L.B.O.Y.S).<br />
<br />
I know you think they're saints,<br />
But mama im here to tell,<br />
Those B.O.Y.S they're just E.V.I.L,<br />
Those boys are evil,<br />
They're makin me feel like my head is in hydrolic depress,<br />
And that don't feel to good,<br />
Those boys are evil,<br />
Everybody,<br />
( E.V.I.L.B.O.Y.S),<br />
Thats what im talkin about,<br />
E.V.I.L.B.O.Y.S ,<br />
Thats right those boys are evil little boys!

Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Wir Phindroid-Ferboter singen stetts dieses Lied,<br />
Und wir maschieren zu technischem Roboter-Beat,<br />
Uns're Augen strahl'n hell,<br />
Uns're Nasen sind Dosen,<br />
Wir tanzen supercool in mechanischen Posen,<br />
(tanzen supercool in mechanischen Posen),<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter<br />

Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Phindroid-Ferboter,<br />
Wir Phindroid-Ferboter schalten uns jetzt ab,<br />
Haben viel getragen, sind nun müde und schlapp,<br />
Noch ein letztes...<br />
(Candace: *Stöhn* 80er sind sowas von 2002. Mom! Mom, Mom!<br />
Mom: Hallo Schatz. Ich Hab' ein paar nette Fotos dabei. Hier.<br />
Candace: Ja, das freut mich, Mom. Sieh dir das an. Tadaa.<br />
Mom: Das ist doch nur ein Sack voll dünger, Candace.<br />
Candace: Was? *Schrei*<br />
Mom: Candace, was erschreckst du mich denn so?<br />
Candace: Vielleicht ist es noch nicht zu spät.)<br />
Noch ein letztes Tänzchen,<br />
Wir Phindroid Ferboter schalten uns jetzt ab,<br />
(Candace: Mom, Mom! Das musst du dir ansehen!)<br />
Haben viel getragen, sind nun müde und schlapp,<br />
(Candace: Ich weiß, das hab' ich schon mal zu mal gesagt, aber heute kann cih mit absuluter Sicherheit beweisen, dass wir Phineas- und Ferb-Roboter in unserem Garten haben. Sieh es dir an!<br />
Mom: Ja, Candace, da sind tatsächlich Phineas- und Ferb-Roboter in unserem Garten)<br />

<br />
My baby's got her own way of talking<br />
Whenever she says something sweet<br />
And she knows it's my world she's a rockin'<br />
Though my vocabulary's incomplete<br />
And Though it may sound confusing<br />
Sometimes I wish she'd give it to me straight<br />
But I never feel like I'm Losing (losing)<br />
When I take the time to translate<br />
That's what i'm talking 'bout<br />
<br />
Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!<br />
mow mow mow and my heart starts pumpin'<br />
chika chika chu wa<br />
Never Gonna Stop Gitchi Gitchi Goo means That I Love You<br />
<br />
Well I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)<br />
But I think i'm getting through (I think I'm getting through)<br />
'Cause when i say I Love You (I Say I Love You)<br />
She says I Gitchi Gitchi Goo You Too!<br />
Don't need a Dictionary<br />
<br />
(I said A) Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!<br />
mow mow mow and my heart starts pumpin'<br />
chika chika chu wa<br />
Never Gonna Stop Gitchi Gitchi Goo means That I Love You (Baby, Baby...)

A clip from Walt Disney's 'Fantasia' (which was used again in 'Fantasia 2000'). The Sorcerer's Apprentice tells the story of an apprentice who cannot control the magic that he has tried to use, with Mickey Mouse in the role of the apprentice.<br />
<br />
It was suppose to be Mickey's first appearance in his current design today, but wasn't released till 1940. So Mickey's current design was first seen in a short subject 'The Pointer' in 1939.

This song is called Come Home Perry from the episode Oh, There You Are Perry and is sung by Phineas, Ferb, Candace, The Fireside Girls, and people of the Tri-State Area. Here are the Lyrics:<br />
<br />
Perry, you know you are a boy's best friend!<br />
You're more than just a passing trend!<br />
You're like a treat from a candy store.<br />
<br />
Oh Perry, we love you more than ice cream cakes<br />
We love you more than bugs and snakes!<br />
We love you more than all things mentioned before.<br />
<br />
Oh Perry, you're extraordinary,<br />
You're kinda short and hairy,<br />
The color of a blueberry,<br />
Yes Perry!<br />
<br />
So come home Perry, Come home Perry,<br />
Come home!<br />
<br />
Oh Perry, I think it's kinda scary<br />
I can't find you anywhere-y,<br />
It fills me with despair-y?<br />
<br />
Oh, Perry! I'm allergic to dairy,<br />
I'm gonna move to the prairie,<br />
And change my name to Larry!<br />
<br />
Larry? (I ran out of rhymes, okay?)<br />
<br />
She'll change her name to Larry! (Larry!) (Larry!)<br />
<br />
So come home Perry,<br />
Come home Perry,<br />
Come home!<br />
<br />
So come home Perry,<br />
Come home Perry,<br />
Come home!<br />
<br />
Come home Perry, come home!

Queen<br />
A Kind Of Magic<br />
A Kind Of Magic<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
A kind of magic,<br />
One dream, one soul, one prize,<br />
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
One shaft of light that shows the way,<br />
No mortal man can win this day,<br />
It's a mind of magic,<br />
The bell that rings inside your mind,<br />
It's a challenging the doors of time,<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
The waiting seems eternity,<br />
The day will dawn of sanity,<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
There can be only one,<br />
This rage that lasts a thousand years<br />
Will soon be gone,<br />
[ Queen Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]<br />
This flame that burns inside of me,<br />
I'm hearing secret harmonies<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
The bell that rings inside your mind,<br />
Is challenging the doors of time,<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
This rage that lasts a thousand years,<br />
Will soon be will soon be,<br />
Will soon be gone,<br />
This is a kind of magic,<br />
Tere can only be one,<br />
This life that lasts a thousand years,<br />
Will soon be gone,<br />
Magic - it's a kind of magic,<br />
It's a kind of magic,<br />
Magic, magic, magic, magic,<br />
It's magic,<br />
It's a kind of magic.

<li>Candle-In-The-Wind</li>
                
Goodbye England's rose<br />
May you ever grow in our hearts<br />
You were the grace that placed itself<br />
Where lives were torn apart<br />
You called out to our country<br />
And you whispered to those in pain<br />
Now you belong to heaven<br />
And the stars spell out your name<br />
<br />
And it seems to me you lived your life<br />
Like a candle in the wind<br />
Never fading with the sunset<br />
When the rain set in<br />
And your footsteps will always fall you<br />
Along England's greenest hills<br />
Your candle's burned out long before<br />
Your legend never will<br />
<br />
Loveliness we've lost<br />
These empty days without your smile<br />
This torch we'll always carry<br />
For our nation's golden child<br />
And even though we try<br />
The truth brings us to tears<br />
All our words cannot express<br />
The joy you brought us through the years<br />
<br />
And it seems to me you lived your life<br />
Like a candle in the wind<br />
Never fading with the sunset<br />
When the rain set in<br />
And your footsteps will always fall you<br />
Along England's greenest hills<br />
Your candle's burned out long before<br />
Your legend never will<br />
<br />
Goodbye England's rose<br />
May you ever grow in our hearts<br />
You were the grace that placed itself<br />
Where lives were torn apart<br />
Goodbye England's rose<br />
From a country lost without your soul<br />
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion<br />
More than you'll ever know<br />
<br />
And it seems to me you lived your life<br />
Like a candle in the wind<br />
Never fading with the sunset<br />
When the rain set in<br />
And you footsteps will always fall you<br />
Along England's greenest hills<br />
Your candle's burned out long before<br />
Your legend never will
