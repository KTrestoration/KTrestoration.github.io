Classic video games had a lot of charm. Think about Pac Man, Donkey Kong and Space Invaders. They were made of a handful of pixels. But they were cool. That said, I'm glad they stayed on my TV. What would happen if they escaped into our world? This animated short will show you. This is really well done.

Farming is mostly run by big businesses in this country. You rarely hear about small, family-run farms anymore. But Nolan's dairy in Ohio is truly a family operation. It feels like something from a simpler time. Everyone has a hand in producing the Nolan's cheese. This family is an inspiration.

There's something fascinating about giant fountains choreographed to music. The Bellagio Fountain in Las Vegas jumps to mind. But the Dubai Fountain in the United Arab Emirates might have it beat. It's the most technologically advanced fountain in the world. It shoots jets of water higher than a 50-story building. See for yourself.

Super Mario Bros. came out 25 years ago. But it’s still a great video game. And it continues to inspire really creative people. Take this guy, for example. He accompanies the game with his violin. He provides the sound effects and soundtrack. And he’s really good at it. Who knew you could combine video games and classical music?

This video was shot in communities in Brazil, France, India and the United Kingdom. All the painters are actual residents. With a few brush strokes, they transform their homes.

Transportation is a growing problem around the world. More vehicles on the road lead to more traffic and pollution. This inventor thinks he has a solution. Called the Shweeb, it combines a monorail with a bicycle. People can pedal to work safely above the traffic.

Men's Rhythmic Gymnastics doesn't sound very interesting at first. But it's definitely something you have to see to believe. The incredible timing and intricate precision of movements is phenomenal. Trust me. You will be in awe by the end.
