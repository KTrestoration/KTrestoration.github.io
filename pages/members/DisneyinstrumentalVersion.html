<li>Beauty and the Beast - Something There (Instrumental )</li>
                
Here's the instrumental music to the song 'Something There' from Beauty and the Beast. There is some unreleased instrumental music before the song plays. It's another wonderful piece from Alan Menken.<br />

<li>Beauty-and-the-Beast-Music--The-Battle-on-the-Tower</li>
                
Here is the music played during the scenes when the furniture launches their attack on the invaders, the escape of Belle and her father, the fight between Gaston and the Beast on the tower, and finally the death of Gaston. I love the 'Be Our Guest' intro when the furniture first attacks the men. :-)<br />

<li>The-Little-Mermaid-Isolated-Score-Part-1-of-9</li>
                
Here is the Academy Award winning music to Disney's 1989 animated feature, 'The Little Mermaid.' The music has minor SFX, but it's been mostly isolated for your enjoyment. Almost 20 years old yet it seems like it just came out yesterday.<br />
