I used audio from leroy and stitch, plus my own footage, to make this. I do not own leroy and stitch in any way. Please excuse the out-of-sync audio and my hand.

Okay, I have this series called Dumb Thok, but I haven't posted anything yet, so I figured I'd start out with a movie as a kind of back door pilot. This is supposed to be a comedy show, but I figured I had better start it out with some action. We don't see Thok in this part, but this is the important begining that will make sense later in the movie. Enjoy!

This part isn't very long, but there is a bonus warrior cats animation at the end, called How the fight of the moonpool should have gone. It loops a few times.
