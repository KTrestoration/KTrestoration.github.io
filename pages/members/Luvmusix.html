Nat angrily goes somewhere else<br />
Thomas and alex look at kristina<br />
<br />
Kristina: (sighs) well since nat and rosalina broke up, when nat greeted her he wasnt all excited so rosalina quit the band.<br />
<br />

Alex: what lameos copying the nbb!!!!!!<br />
<br />
TV Reporter: the new band: SSB, Has been voted better than the naked brothers band,even tho it only started with five votes,last week! Many say that all of this improvment is thanks to a new bass player/singer, Rosalina Dimeco.<br />
<br />

<br />
Savanna looked at him,cautiusly leanedd in,and kissed him.<br />
<br />
