Welcome to my first ever LP and today I'm going to start the legend of Zelda ocarina of Time. I won't be going through 100% like i said in the video, but i will collect most of the golden skullultulas until i get the Giant Wallet. But i will get every item that you need to beat the game for example (Biggorons Sword Highly Recommended, all the boots, suits, and everything like that). Happily the video has good quality and there's NO BLACK SCREEN!!! Yay! So hope you all enjoy!

We do level 6, and first we do ANOTHER ordon target practice, then we get to kill some piggies and THEN we go to an ice place and kill some ice statues (or whatever they're called)

We do level 5, dangit, looks like i'll have to put in the real text later because i FORGOT the second level! And after we beat level 5, WE HAVE TO DO IT AAGAIN, because i didn't get a medal!
