This is my first NightFall soundtrack video. NightFall is a video game I may make sometime. It may take months, years, maybe even DECADES!!! Anyway, this it the music that plays when you learn the controls of the game.

More music from the soon-to-be-game NightFall. This music plays when you have a trial to see how well you play.

I hate how ROBLOX won't let kids 13 and under name their places, but here's a quick tour of my game place!
