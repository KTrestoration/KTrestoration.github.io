I spent a month on this video! So, WATCH IT! I want to say I do not own anything in this video I just put it together.It is kind of long, but who cares,THIS IS MY FIRST VIDEO!!!! :D P.S. the songs from Leafpool and Bluestar are from Kidz Bop because the real songs wouldn't fit in Windows Movie Maker. Oh, and on Lionblaze I meant to put Lionblaze on it but I messed up and put Lionpaw.<br />
The reason I chose these songs are:<br />
<br />
Firestar -Here WIthout You by 3 Doors Down -He's Here Without Spottedleaf, and he dreams about her all the time.<br />
<br />
Leafpool - Unwritten from kidz bop 10 -It Just felt right.<br />
<br />
Squirrelflight -Misery Business by Paramore - I can't really explain it.<br />
<br />
Brambleclaw - crushcrushcrush by Paramore - Brambleclaw noticed that Fireheart was always staring at him and Brambleclaw thought that Fireheart was lying in the 5th book. Plus, the tune is kinda like him.<br />
<br />
Jayfeather - Only the Young by Journey - It felt right.<br />
<br />
Lionblaze -Life is a Highway re-recorded by Rascal Flatts - I really wanted to have Lionblaze on here but the Song I wanted to use wouldn't fit in WMM.<br />
<br />
Ashfur- She's Got a Boyfriend Now by Boys Like Girls - Simple, Squirrelflight's got a mate now!<br />
<br />
Yellowfang -That's What You Get by Paramore - That's what Yellowfang got for mating with Raggedstar(Yellowfang got an evil son).<br />
<br />
Bluestar - Because of You from Kidz Bop10 - Because of Tigerstar she found it hard to trust her Clan.<br />
<br />
Graystripe - Separate Ways (Worlds Apart) by Journey - After Silverstream and Feathertail died all he had left was Stormfur. Someday love found him.<br />
<br />
Ravenpaw - The Great Escape by Boys Like Girls - He made The Great Escape. (Duh!! xD)<br />
<br />
Stormfur - How Far We've Come by Matchbox 20 - I can't really explain it.<br />
<br />
Hawkfrost and Tigerstar - Decode from Twilight by Paramore - People thought that Hawkfrost was good but later he turned bad. Bluestar thought she knew Tigerstar well. Plus the tune is kinda like them.<br />
<br />
Scourge - Decode from Twilight by Paramore - There is something in him that can kill you.<br />
<br />
Credits Song - Misery Business by Paramore<br />
<br />
                   ENJOY!! :) B) :3<br />

Now I know what your thinking, WHY IS TIGERSTAR AND TAWNYPELT IN THIS VIDEO???? Well, Tigerstar is Brambleclaw's father which makes Tigerstar Firestar's brother in law, and why Tawnypelt is in here is because she is Brambleclaw's sister which makes her Firestar's daughter in law.<br />

I made this video out of boredom. It took me 20 minutes to make it. The song in the video is Welcome to the Jungle by Guns N' Roses. All the pictures came from Deviantart.com.<br />
One part in the video sounds like it's messed up, but it's not. I had to fix it because it had a bad word in it.<br />
Anyways, ENJOY!!! :) B) :3 xD
