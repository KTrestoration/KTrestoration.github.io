<li>Meet-Rasberry</li>
                
This is a video to meet my character, Rasberry who is featured in most of my videos. The characters are Rasberry and Audrey. It's not as good as my more recent animations, but I just uploaded it anyway

<li>Down-Meme-Animation</li>
                
This is a meme that I animated. The original was by NightmareSpriter on Youtube, but this is my version. Chicken Little was right! The sky is falling

<li>Who-put-the-Jalapenos-in-the-Salsa-Animation</li>
                
This is an animation I made in Toon Boom. It features a family of chibi cats and the story of some very spicy salsa.

<li>We-ran-out-of-Rasberries</li>
                
This was an animation I did for youtube, it the story of what happens to the characters Rasberry and Callie when they don't have any more rasberries and Rasberry goes crazy trying to get some. The song at the end is the nom nom nom song by Parry Gripp.

<li>Anime-Cat-Speed-Paint</li>
                
This is my first ever speed paint! It is an anime cat that I did in Photoshop and sped up with Windows Movie Maker. The actual drawing took about an hour. The music is Soul Sister by Train and Rhythm of Love by Plain White T's.
