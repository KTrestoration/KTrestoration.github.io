A friend of mine played it in slowmotion when Chip and Dale speaks...<br />
You can hear what they say clearly<br />
<br />
Watch this and please comment...<br />

Walt disney's forbidden Donald duck episode! I'm not uploaded it because i'm sort of a racist or something, but it just is for the people who think this is funny! Enjoy!

1949, high quality. Marvelous episode with Chip and Dale.<br />
<br />
Why the new version? Well, just compare with the old one and you'll see this one has vastly superior quality. I don't feel like removing the old one because it's my most popular video. Still, please update your favorites.

A song that is written specially for the Disney Princess franchise. It features the voice of Jodi Benson as Ariel, Judy Kuhn as Pocahontas, Paige O'Hara as Belle, Lea Salonga as Jasmine and Mulan, Christie Houser as Aurora and Susan Stevens Logan as Cinderella.<br />
<br />
This video is not made by me! I confess that I don't have such skills. This is an official Disney video made by the official, important people at Disney.<br />

If You Can Dream<br />
<br />
There is a world where hope<br />
And dreams can last for all time<br />
A wondrous place to go<br />
You'll know it when your heart finds<br />
<br />
Hearing our song as old as rhyme<br />
Hold my hand we're gonna fly<br />
What a magic ride<br />
And just a kiss away<br />
<br />
If you can dream<br />
The wish we're making<br />
On a star is coming true<br />
The colours of the wind will lead<br />
My heart right back to you<br />
<br />
'Cause if you can dream<br />
Reflections in a diamond sky<br />
Come shining on true<br />
Romance will always be so new<br />
And love will save the day<br />
If you can dream<br />
<br />
Someday my prince will come<br />
It's certain as the sun rise<br />
One day the slipper fits<br />
Then you see the love in his eyes<br />
<br />
It's a tale as old as time<br />
There's no mountain we can't climb<br />
When you're finally mine<br />
And just a kiss away<br />
<br />
If you can dream<br />
The wish we're making<br />
On a star is coming true<br />
The colours of the wind will lead<br />
My heart right back to you<br />
<br />
'Cause if you can dream<br />
Reflections in a diamond sky<br />
Come shining on true<br />
Romance will always be so new<br />
And love will save the day<br />
If you can dream<br />
<br />
So the story goes<br />
Never die the rose<br />
There's a whole new world<br />
Waiting there for us<br />
(Waiting just for us)<br />
<br />
If you can dream<br />
The wish we're making<br />
On a star is coming true<br />
The colours of the wind will lead<br />
My heart right back to you<br />
<br />
'Cause if you can dream<br />
Reflections in a diamond sky<br />
Come shining on true<br />
Romance will always be so new<br />
And love will save the day<br />
Love will say the day<br />
If you can dream

<li>Donald-Duck--Up-a-Tree</li>
                
1955. High quality version.<br />
<br />
One of the very last episodes, along with Dragon Around(1954) and Chips Ahoy(1956), with which ended the Disney shorts unit.<br />
<br />
In these episodes, both Chip and Dale feature larger eyes and generally look more baby-like, especially Dale. IMO, their reference drawing is in Chicken in the Rough and Two Chips and a Miss.<br />
<br />
On a more positive note, no old samples were re-used to do the chipmunks voices in these episodes, and they are much easier to understand than before.

1956, high quality. (TrueHQ available if you click 'Watch in High Quality' or add &fmt=18 to the URL.)<br />
<br />
Last episode ever made featuring classic Donald Duck and Chip and Dale. Yes I know Disney made so-called new ones in 1999, but it's simply not the same thing.<br />
<br />
This is the first time this episode was released in high quality on Youtube. Not only that, but in cinemascope! Enjoy!<br />
<br />
(UPDATE: Youtube just decided to go widescreen, just after I released a version of this adapted for 4:3. Result : evil letterboxing. I'll have to submit a real widescreen version at some point.)

Viimeinen suomennokseni vähään aikaan. Tietokoneelta kestää ikuisuus tallentaa suomennokseni Aku Ankka -episodeista joten tämä on viimeinen suomennos Aku Ankoista. Pitäkää hauskaa! :D<br />

My last finnish subtitled Donald Duck episode. My computer takes forever to just finish up my subtitled Donald Duck -episodes so enjoy this last Finnish subtitled Donald Duck episode from me for awhile. Have fun!
