What I thought wasn't mine<br />
In the light<br />
Wasn't one of a kind,<br />
a precious pearl<br />
<br />
When I wanted to cry<br />
I couldn't 'cause I<br />
wasn't allowed<br />
<br />
Gomenasai for everything<br />
Gomenasai, I knowI let you down<br />
Gomenasai till the end<br />
I never needed a friend<br />
Like I do now<br />
<br />
What I thought wasn't all<br />
So innocent<br />
Was a delicate doll<br />
of porcelian<br />
<br />
When I wanted to call you<br />
And ask you for help<br />
I stopped myself<br />
<br />
Gomenasai for everything<br />
Gomenasai, I knowI let you down<br />
Gomenasai till the end<br />
I never needed a friend<br />
Like I do now<br />
<br />
What I thought was a dream<br />
a mirage<br />
Was as real as it seemed<br />
A privilege<br />
<br />
When I wanted to tell you<br />
I made a mistake<br />
I walked away<br />
<br />
Gomenasai for everything<br />
Gomenasai, ( repeat 4X)<br />
I knowI let you down<br />
Gomenasai till the end<br />
I never needed a friend<br />
Like I do now<br />
<br />
Gomenasai, I let you down<br />
Gomenasai, (repeat 2x)<br />
Gomenasai till the end<br />
I never needed a friend<br />
Like I do now

Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi was a short-lived show on Cartoon Network, running from 2004 to 2006. Although cliche, it was a fun show to watch, and deserves to be back online. I will be uploading the entire third season in English for all two or three of you that remember this show. Watch, rate and comment!
