This part kind of gets real annoying because Michael keeps on saying 'Spaghetti' almost every minute! So we just completed the tower and finished an edible swimming level, then we defeat the big bad MOMA! Hope you enjoy!

Welcome to world 2 the dessert region, also known as 'Dessert Colossus'. It's not really called that, but i just feel like it anyways. We did a good chunck of levels, all the way to the tower and beat it!

This is kind of different because i'm using my camera to record the video because i'm afraid that something will mess up with Windows Movie Maker like last time i used it it took really long to import so i'm using my camera.
