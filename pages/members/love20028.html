me at mysteryship im the only girl in my group. EDIT: Ah...I remember that. We lost by 2 points. I was on the 5th grade team even though i was a 3rd grader the grades that there were was 4th and 5th. Now that im old enough to be on my own grades team im happier. Last year we lost to 4th. not the other 5th one. Me 1st team broke off me and michael got put on 5 amigos. i picked that 1 cause the other 3rd grader was on that team. my friend kelsey got put on the moonwalkers. Our team captin was okay... i wonder if any of them r on here. they r 6th now... probably not. okay edit 1 done.

reasons 1:I have been on for a long time 2:I frenquently check the blogs when im on. 3:I get on as much as possible when i have no homework or anything to do. 4: I enjoy helping people. I would be helping you, Kidstube staff, and snyone on here. I lost the pass to my old account, 02kmc made this account and later found the pass to 02kmc but did not abandon this 1 cause too much progress and i still get on that 1 a little. EDIT: THNX!!! im in 2nd place! keep on voting! Over 600 veiws!
