Lyrics:
Got my helmet on my head
Figure out what that zombie said
Lava all over the room 
Gotta' half heart left, man, I am doomed/nDon't have any iron bars 
Pick just broke into some shards
Scary noise what should I do
Go left or right I'll have to choose/nVisions of last time, flash inside my mind
I'm scared, OH WELL
And I'm pretty sure, there's a big creeper 
Right there! (Dang)/n(Don't mine at night ) 
I know your lookin' at that cave
And your feelin' kinda' brave. 
Go to bed you'll be alright /n(Don't mine at night) 
There's nothing that is gonna' change
If you just wait until the day  
Zombie wanna' eat your brains/n(Don't mine at night)
I know it's me your gonna' thank
 Make a bed it's not too late
3 wool and 3 wooden planks/n(Don't mine at night)
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a
Woah/nDon't mine at night
(don't mine at night )
Don't mine at night 
(don't mine at night)/nStomach's all tied up in knots
This labyrinth, I'm gettin' lost
This is really gettin' old 
Found like 2 pieces of coal/nDown one way there's just stone
Monsters won't leave me alone
Down another there's some lava 
And of course I get, PWND /nRemember last time I tried to mine at night
I failed, so bad/nI lost all my stuff
It was really tough
That's it (RAGE QUIT!)/n(Don't mine at night ) 
I know your lookin' at that cave
And your feelin' kinda' brave. 
Go to bed you'll be alright /n(Don't mine at night) 
There's nothing that is gonna' change
If you just wait until the day  
Zombie wanna' eat your brains/n(Don't mine at night)
I know it's me your gonna' thank
 Make a bed it's not too late
3 wool and 3 wooden planks/n(Don't mine at night)
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a
Woah/nDon't mine at night
(don't mine at night )
Don't mine at night 
(don't mine at night)/nD-O-N-T   M-I-N-E  x4
