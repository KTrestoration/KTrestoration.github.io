The sequel to Cool Pictures. The aurora pictures are very interesting! How auroras happen: At night, if light from the sun gets trapped by clouds and can't escape, the light transforms into an aurora! Auroras are very rare, however. Enjoy the pictures!

Ok- 2 things. One is, I did the math, and in this series of videos, there will be 21 episodes. the 3 Call of Legends episodes in each series and the 4 Battle Stadium episodes for each series. This DOESN'T mean I will stop making stop-action pokemon videos. I will just be doing small ones. 2: You can expect probably 1 Pokemon video each week. I hope you enjoy this one!
