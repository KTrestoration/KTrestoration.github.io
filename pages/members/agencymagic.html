Eye Spy: Kaitlin had a simple life when she was small . . .  That changed. She started to live a life of change . . . then secrets.<br />
As she grew up in them, she knew one day she would have to face the truth. <br />
As the days go by, Love falls on her brother. And Kaitlin has to deal with him too. <br />
But at a time when her secrets are revealed. . . she gets a life. <br />
But when she finds a secret to her name . . . Katalina . . . Secrets don't seem so harsh. <br />
Then she finds the key that might reveal everything. How will she take it? <br />
With Travel, she tries to get away from everything.  Only to bring more danger with her. <br />
She finds she is part of the test. A danger to everything. <br />
And now anger is a issue, she uses her danger and strife knowing the truth. <br />
How can she reach for stars. . . When there is none anymore . . . And the stars weren't what she thought? <br />
What does the future hold? How will she choose her path? How will she choose who to love? <br />
Now that she knows <br />
