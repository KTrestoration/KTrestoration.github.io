Todd Jackson Jr is a awesome 9 year old athlete with extraordinary work ethic.  He dominates every sport his parents put him in.  He has practiced basketball since he could walk everyday.  He has won awards at many different sports clinics and leagues around the Southern California area.  Todd has unbelievable speed and agility as well as an amazing physique due to his extreme self-motivated regimen.  He is also a straight "A" student and outstanding young citizen.  He has worked so hard to build on his natural talent, he deserves national recognition./nThank you for your interest.
