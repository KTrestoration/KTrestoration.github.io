Watch this, guys! It's an awesome game and I really love Mecha Kracko! He's my fave boss for Squeak Squad and he is way better than Yadogaine, the insect crab thing.

This is a cool intro to watch. And I love Adventure Time! That's why I want to make this instead of continuing my Amazing World of Gumball parody series.

<li>Japanese-and-English-Sing-Along-Song-Shake-it-Up</li>
                
I originally worked on that last night but I made it today anyway. Birdo and Yoshi are singing the song in the video, the audio singer is ShayShay, a Japanese child singer who can sing in English too. Remember Slippy's "Someone Like You"? ShayShay sang that in the audio too. Selena Gomez originally sings "Shake it Up". ShayShay isn't her real name, it's the stage name of Sashimie Yoshimoto, 10-year-old sister of Sushie, a Japanese seiyuu.

Since you never seen this before, here it is. Never heard of Atoka sisters? They're young voice actresses from Oklahoma.

This was filmed when we were watching Gnomeo & Juliet, one of my fave 2011 movies! And btw, I used a Kodak camera to record this and sorry about the video being so short but enjoy.

This comes from my fave part of the Triaminic's 102 commercial. The funny part has the guy that drops a brick and he went like "102? NOOOOOO!!!" and I decided to make this.

<li>The 2012 Chevrolet Sonic Fanmade Commercial by Me!</li>
                
I used Sonic the Hedgehog characters in the commercial because the name of the car is the Sonic.
