This is my favorite show, and possibly my favorite part in the whole series. This show is called Doctor Who, and it rules. Just saying....

In November, Doctor Who is having its 50th Anniversary. Normally, I'd watch Doctor Who all day, while eating fish fingers with custard, and wearing a bowtie. But instead I did that AND edited this. This is my first attempt at a trailer of sorts, and I'd highly appreciate it if you rate it, comment, and subscribe! Also, there's a new Kidstube series by ME in your future, plus some vlogs in the making!

This is my first video in which I appear! Anyways, I hope you enjoy! Tragic story: I had finished this in my editor, Sony Vegas, and was about to render it. But my power went out because it was storming, and my computer crashed! I lost it and I was going to have a lot more in it, for example, an intro before I started listing the five things. But enough about that! I'm planning on having a Q&A video, so leave all your questions in the comments, or message me! Peace out!

I know, I know! All I've been uploading is music! But I am 90% sure I'll have my new video up by next week! I've been incredibly busy, and haven't had time to edit. I lost all the footage from my camera, so I have to re-film it, and then edit it. (*gags*). I hope you enjoy this song though! I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE US CRAY!

I took the trailers of my two favorite movies, and then mashed them together. I mad every bit of this video, except the clips, which were from the movies. I also made the titles at the end using a new program I have:D
