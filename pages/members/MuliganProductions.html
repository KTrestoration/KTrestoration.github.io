Almost everyone knows this song, but nobody knows the real man who first created it. This video will hopefully live on, since it's over 30 years old. You can find hundreds of remixed versions, but you will only find ONE original.

I'm making a sad thirty-minute movie called Muligan: The Movie. Basically, all the events in the upcoming movie are fake, or are based on minor things that have happened in Muligan's lifetime. It is sad, but I rate it G or PG! :D nMuligan kind of 'narrates' it, so it'll be cool. But anywayyyyy here is the 1st trailer!!! IT IS AWESOME BECAUSE I CREATED IT. :) nplease rate and comment, also please give me some ideas to put in the movie!!
