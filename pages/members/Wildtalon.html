My first animation. I want to dedicate this to Wolfy Productions. Without her, i wouldn't be able to upload this. I messed up on the part where Graystripe sees Silverstream. Sorry. Well, hope you like what i have.

<li>-Kira-Part-1</li>
                
This is the first part of a movie I'm animating. I had to use my voice for both of the wolves, Kira and her mother Tikia. Sorry, no auditions cause I dunno how to add voices from here to my movie.<br />
<br />
'Kira' is about a female wolf pup named Kira who is always picked on for being scared of everything. She needs to prove herself. Hope u like it!

<li>Baily Voice Auditioning for House Cats</li>
                
Well, as the title says, this is for Momotaro's House Cats. I want to be Baily, not that I'm copying Wolfy, it's just... I want to get a she-cat part and I want the she-cat to be SUPER nice. So...yeah.

The first episode. There'll be plenty videos like this to come! In other videos, Kita might be telling stories about things that happened to her, sharing great news, or maybe introducing another character! Hope you like it! It took me more than half an hour but less than an hour.

Special thanks to WolfyProductions, who showed me an awesome video from YouTube of how to upload music onto Windows Movie Maker. Hope you like it. I just picked out a random song (Which is also one of my favorites, as said on my channel) Bones Shatter.

I'm obsessed with this song! Hope you like it too<br />
<br />
Falling a thousand feet per second<br />
You still take me by surprise<br />
I just know we can't be over<br />
I can see it in your eyes<br />
<br />
Making any kind of silence<br />
Takes a lot to realize<br />
It's worst to finish than to start all over and never let it lie<br />
<br />
And as along as I can feel you holding on<br />
I won't fall even if you said I was wrong<br />
<br />
I'm not perfect<br />
But I keep trying<br />
'Cause that's what I said I would do from the start<br />
<br />
I'm not alive if I'm lonely<br />
So please don't leave<br />
Was it something I said<br />
Or just my personality<br />
<br />
Making every kind of silence<br />
It takes a lot to realize<br />
It's worst to finish than to star all over and never let it lie<br />
<br />
And as long as I can feel you holding on<br />

Even if you said I was wrong<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not alive if I'm lonely<br />
So please don't leave<br />
Was it something I said<br />
Or just my personality<br />
<br />
When you're caught in a lie<br />
You've got nothing to hide<br />
When you've got no where to run<br />
Then you've got nothing inside<br />
<br />
I tears right through there<br />
You thought that you knew me<br />
You thought that you knew<br />
<br />
I'm not perfect<br />
But I'll keep trying<br />
Just like I said I would do from the start<br />
<br />
I'm not alive if I'm lonely<br />
So please don't leave<br />
Was it something I said<br />

'Cause that's what I said I would do from the start<br />
<br />
I'm alive if I'm lonely<br />
So please don't leave<br />
Was it something I said<br />
Or just my, just my, self!<br />
<br />
Just myself<br />
Myself<br />
Just myself<br />
<br />
I'm not perfect<br />
But I'll keep trying.<br />
