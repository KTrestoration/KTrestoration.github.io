Well YouTubers... here it is. The crown jewel of my animation abilities so far as it stands. This is a spoof on Steven Spielburg's who can ever forget...(drum roll)..."Freakazoid!!!"
After this, my animation activity will be at a minimum, BUT... I will place other vids on every week. This doesn't mean I'm done animating but I do have to create more characters and stuff in order to make more animations. And don't forget to comment, rate, or subscribe... or even all three... after the video. Enjoy!!! :D!!!

Ok peoples, I know this was promised to some to be a Thanksgiving upload but seeing it's the 26th...oh well.
This is my first try at a music vid with my characters.
That video is "It's Tough To Be A God" from the "DreamWorks" major motion picture, "The Road To El' Dorato". Really the only thing that this video proves is that I don't entirely suck at music vids. Just a bit. Well, for those who haven't comment, rate, or subscribed, please do so after the video.
Enjoy!!! :D!!!

Three Tee Productions gives unto you an epic gift of the season. I just want to thank all those who helped my channel and videos get views.

EDIT: This Is a very old video project I made 2 years ago/nAn epic telling of the story within the famous Milton Bradley game "Candy Land," three adventures, Calico Jack Renegade Robbie, and their new-found friend with no name, embark on one of the greatest adventures ever told, the lost city of Candy Land.While on their trail, the Evil Dr. Curl, and his two bumbling henchmen are after the same prize they are. With rotting outfits, secret clues, to fast speed chasing go-carts, and guest star Nathan Lane, this movie will have you wanting to see it again and again. With the music talents of John Williams and Hans Zimmer. This is truly the crown jewel to Three Tee Productions.
