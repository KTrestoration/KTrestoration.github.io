Authors on Ebooks Authors on Ebooks “Part of what ebooks can do is to make it possible for a lot of knowledge and wisdom to be portable,” says Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker. Walker and her fellow Open Road authors Richelle Mead, Pat Conroy, Brian Freemantle, Martyn Waites, Dori Hillestad Butler, and Scott Spencer have experienced the benefits of ebooks from both a writer’s and reader’s perspective. With their portability, purchasing convenience, multimedia offerings, and ability to attract reluctant readers, ebooks have changed the world of reading. Watch as these Open Road authors discuss the role ebooks play in their lives and in the lives of their readers.

"Everything I write about is from my childhood in one way or another. I think that maybe inside this body is a very young person" says author Patricia MacLachlan who has taken on the mantle of writing the very first Boxcar Children prequel. "I felt a great responsibility to really protect these characters. They are resourceful, they are kind to one another, and we can learn from them," she says. As a Newbery Award Winner and best-selling author of more than 20 children's books, MacLachlan notes: "The rules for writing for children are never to talk down to them." I don't try to educate, I try to tell a story so they can find themselves in there somewhere."

“When you are afraid in the dark,” says young adult author Caroline B. Cooney, “even though you know perfectly well it’s the same old maple tree brushing against the side of the house, it’s so much more fun to think that it’s something else . . . something filled with menace.” Cooney has written more than ninety suspense, mystery, and romance novels for teenagers, which have sold over fifteen million copies and are published in several languages. Her writing has earned her a vast following; she believes teens “want to think about deep things—like loyalty, need, and hope.” Watch this video of Cooney describing how she creates a perfect thriller for a YA audience.

“There’s nothing more satisfying to me than taking a nonreader and turning him into a reader,” says Dori Hillestad Butler, author of the Buddy Files children’s book series. Kids who struggle with reading often find it hard to catch up once they’ve fallen behind, especially after a summer spent away from school. Books that have capitvating stories but are written at lower-difficulty reading levels, can help these reluctant readers feel more confident, and eventually bring them into the fold. As author Peter Lerangis says, “the deep secret is reading is fun. Once you start doing it, you realize this is amazing!” Watch this video to hear these authors, along with Patricia Reilly Giff and Anna Perera, discuss how they work toward turning reluctant readers into enthusiastic readers.

"There’s nothing more exciting to me than taking a nonreader and turning them into a reader," says Dori Butler. "Mysteries can do that." Indeed mysteries are often the most engaging books for young readers, teaching them about the unique power of suspense in written form. Many writers of children’s mysteries, including Butler, choose the genre because they have fond memories of how they responded to such books during childhood. "I liked following the clues," says Butler, "seeing if I could figure out the mystery before the detective."
In this exclusive, documentary quality video from Open Road, learn more about why Butler and other children’s book authors, including the prolific Patricia Reilly Giff, love mysteries.

Robin Jarvis spent most of his school years in art rooms. While doodling one evening, he began inventing names and stories to go along with his drawings—and thus began his writing career. “For the Hagwood books, I made a conscious decision to completely invent the whole place. You can get away with a lot more,” says Jarvis, who wanted to “put the reader in that . . . no-idea-what’s-going-to-happen-next sort of place.” In this video, Jarvis talks about his drawing; creating worlds within his writing; and experiencing what he’s writing.
